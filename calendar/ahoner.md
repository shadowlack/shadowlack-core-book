It is said that when the Ramathian deities first brought happiness upon Cyudiah, the Pendragons created a feast in their honour - one of merriness and joy. **Ahoner** was originally far more religious, but over time, the week-long festival has changed into something far different.

Taking place from 231th of Tria to the 241th, Ahoner is a time where one is actually expected to be drunk, high, and running on a thread of one-night-stands. Most notable, though, are the huge celebrity parties which take place during Ahoner in vast mansions until dawn - gatherings of Ramath-lehi's most [well-known figures](/pop-culture-figures) and the idols of society.
