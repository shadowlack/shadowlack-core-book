One of the few [Anubian](/species/anubi) holidays participated by all the Anubi. It is the day of the first victim of the plague was diagnosed, it ends on the day she died. These are days of mourning, prayer, and general worship. Temples display black banners with heavy embroidery. This is the day when many go and visit tombs of their ancestors, or choose to bury those who have died recently of fatal illnesses.
