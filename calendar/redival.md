It is said that the first Ramathians were brought to life at the beginning of Dyo, and they blossomed with the bountiful flowers and thrived with the forests which had already graced the planet for many years before Tanastlasei blessed the earth by forming life from its clay.

Pendragon knowledge advanced more quickly than even the Creator Goddess had expected, and an unsophisticated but functional language had formed among her people before the season was half over. So pleased was the Goddess with her people that she gave them a marvellous gift - fire. Redival is the celebration of the gift of fire, a two-week festival where torches burn proudly in the center of every town and city. Many cultural displays are brought into the streets, such as dancing, play-acting, music, the vending of art, and refined cuisine, to represent and celebrate the continued advancement of Pendragon culture. Redival is considered an auspicious time of prosperity and growth.

Nioties born during Redival are considered blessed by Tanastlasei, and even business agreements, purchases or trades are considered to have good fortune.
