Dressed in costumes (often with themes tied to death, horror, and the macabre, as with the holiday's ancient relation), groups of Ramathians attend huge parties and masquerades that begin at around ten o'clock (this custom was started after the first Tumhuem party). And, just like its Dyo counterpart, [Lybaj'tpui](/calendar/lybajtpui), Tumhuem is the time for partying.

Beginning at 22 hours on the 24th of Mid Tessera (the first night of Tumhuem), the rich and famous will invite over masses of those of their own social standing to their own mansions and estates, with the parties usually ended at around two in the morning.

The party goers then go to sleep during the day until ten o'clock has come around again, and the party is rekindled again. A select few (usually those close to the host) will stay at the host's residence for the entire week, until the holiday has ended. Most hop from party to party.

The exact origins of the holiday are unknown.
