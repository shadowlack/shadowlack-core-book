## Physical description

Sleek yet quite muscular, Achisaki stands five feet at the withers, one could say she is a somewhat a "pretty" pendragon. Her entire body is covered with ebon hued "fur" except for the toes of her paws and the tips of both her ears and tails. Yes, you heard me right... Tails, she has three to be exact each baring a cerulean ball of flame on the tip... She is one of the few exceptional femmes with flamed tails and she tends to find that a blessing at times. She has tattoos around her upper right forelimb representing the six elements (Water, fire, earth, air, light and darkness). When it comes to jewelry, Achisaki has but one article, a pendant... It looks like a normal silver locket engraved with a lost language of some sort but inside is a cerulean stone carved into the shape of a sphere. The stone is known to glow during the day and fade at night, there are many rumors about it which puzzle strangers and even her friends. (Some say it grants her special elemental powers, others say she uses it to derive energy from the spirit world "Fronmia" and that if it were ever taken from her she would render helpless. And yet others deem it a worthless piece of junk. However no one is 100% sure...)

## Personality

If one of her friends were to tell you about her all you would hear are nice things, except the fact no one knows who she is exactly. In fact she used to go by several different names including Oakii, Masai, Saqtari, and Ac'ka Saboticalii. It is rumored now however that she is starting to give out her supposed "real" name. Never the less, she is sweet, gentle, caring, strong willed, and quite a spirited warrior... Oh and we forgot to mention somewhat mysterious and even quiet at times, which makes strangers usually uneasy around her...

## History

No one knows her parents, or any of her family members, it is thought that she was once best friends with Septara Faetix, a mean, cruel, and somewhat insane minded pendragon. She claims he was nothing like that before his parents death, she has her share of believers and doubters when it comes to that story. Records have now found out that she was the mother of Saqqara Naptilia (Who has since been deceased, her death is uncertain... It is also noted that Saqqara's daughter, Moona has disappeared and is believed to be dead as well...), whom she deeply wished she could raise but in the end she had to abandon her. It wasn't out of a cruel nature she said, but rather a constant threat from Septara (Who at that time was much stronger than her). Many would say Achisaki thought of Septara as her brother which in the end proved to be a costly mistake. Achisaki gained strength with her age, soon surpassing her twisted minded friend. It was at her 5 000th year that she taught him a lesson and ripped the skin from his back, leaving his spine exposed as it is today. Besides that, the Graders have been watching her for quite sometime, it is interesting to note that for her age she is stronger than usual and appears to gain strength by day. She has been sent on missions by many and has returned. Everything she does is to prove herself worthy as her friends would say. Or is she trying to buy time for something much grander? Whatever it is, she has plans for sure to give Septara what he deserves...
