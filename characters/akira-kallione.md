## Physical description

She is a somewhat small female, about 5'2" with largish ears that are slightly rounded and a long slightly bushy tail. She has a foxlike face with dark green eyes and light blue fur and has a sandy colored mane of 'scale' hairs that run from the top of her head down to the middle of her back. Most of her fur has various shades of aquamarine blue, giving a mottled look. On her sides and belly, she has flame shaped markings of bright red fur that clash with the blue colors, her tail is a darker blue, almost black in color.

## Personality

She is an outwardly friendly pendragon and is sometimes chatty and is often curious, although she does tend to stick her nose where it  does not belong. Her somewhat wild and slightly haphazard nature is often shown in her mane which is often messy even though she  stays pretty clean. When she really gets excited about something, she can pursue it to an end.

## History

Born in a typical high middle-class family. She was somewhat sheltered from the chaos caused by the takeover of the Graders when she was a student. But, her knowledge and study of the ancient machina and how they work has brought her recognition in the public throughout the world. She has found out some secrets of them and has even gotten some to work. Despite the restrictions on some of the more dangerous machina, she pushes ahead with her study and exploration.
