## Physical description

A tangled, flaming red mane, looking a bit like dreadlocks, adorns his thick neck. A ghostly white, blue tinted pelt covers his figure. Sinewy, large, and oddly colored are the words that best suit him. There's tattoos on his left haunch, shoulder, and cheeks. All are a dark navy. The tattoo on his haunch is a long sword. On his shoulder is the image of a simple phoenix. Another tattoo is a stripe going from his eyes, down his cheeks, and meeting around his muzzle. There are leather strips wrapping around his lower legs, and one crudely tied around his tail. Very rogue-ish.

## Personality

Strong / silent type is the best way to describe him. Though he doesn't mind a conversation, most don't bother to talk to him anyway. If a pendragon gets past his sarcasm, and manages to find his true self, they'll have a loyal friend. 

He is also a smith, and creates his own battle tools. He will make custom weapons, for a price, but it will last many seasons. This is frowned upon by the Graders, as he is only an apprentice. But, he is a rogue, and doesn't care. He also dabbles in fire magic.

## History

He has the noble blood of the Shen family, but doesn't live up to it. Born to be a warrior, he was trained as so until he turned rogue. It suits him much better, and lives for the thrill of doing as he pleases.
