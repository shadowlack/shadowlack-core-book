Amaroq is black with gray spikes on his neck. He has dark purple spots here and there,and his wings are also purple. The part that connects his wing to his back is black, but in between is purple. His talons curve only slightly, but are long. His tail flame is usually black, but occasionally it is purple or blue.

Amaroq is never seen without a leather jacket and blue jeans. He never wears a shirt under his jacket. His ears stick up like a bats' and have small silver hoops in them. He's tall, about six feet and two inches. He has dark eyes and a penetrating gaze, and his voice is husky from living in the desert so long. Amaroq has a lot of scars. The biggest one goes from his right shoulder to his left hip. He doesn't notice when he gets a new scar. His skin is thick enough to protect him most of the time. When it isn't, he carries a knife on his right hip.

Personality
-----------

Amaroq is tough, and has always been a bully when you were mean. He enjoys looking out for others, but he doesn't stay long. He enjoys company, but he always has somewhere else to be.

Amaroq is a lot like a lone wolf. He goes off alone for days on end, just to think. Though he doesn't want to be alone, he often finds that he is. His only companion in life is Jynx, his little sister. Because of that, he fiercely protects her from any harm.

History
-------

When he was born, Amaroq's parents were disappointed. It wasn't until later that he found out they had wanted a girl. They took care of him as a baby, but once he had his feet under him they completely ignored everything he did. He found it was hard to make friends without being able to brag about how much his parents loved him, so he was often alone.

Amaroq was six years old when his mother had another child; a girl. His father began paying attention to him, but only to teach him how to protect his sister. Aamroq practiced fighting for more than just his sister's protection; he wanted to prove he was just as good as Jynx. For three years, his skills grew.

He was nine when he heard his parents fighting. He had been holding Jynx because she had had a bad dream. They were going to break up; they were arguing over who would get Jynx. Amaroq didn't want to by separated from his little sister, so he flew away, taking her with him. They had found their own cave and had livd in it ever since.
