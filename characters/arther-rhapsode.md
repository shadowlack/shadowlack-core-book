## Physical description

There is nothing that would set Arther apart from others. Indeed, in a crowd he is quite capable of blending in with no trouble. One thing that might be noticable would be his wings, made of thick leather, like those of a dragon's. Their color isn't remarkable, black with the faintest shimmer of silver along the edges. Silver-white bladelike fur ranges from the top of his forehead, down his neck, and ends just beneath his shoulder-blades. The majority of his body is colored a dark gray, to seem almost black when in darkness. In light, it would appear almost slate in color, yet most of the time it does appear black. Especially compared to his fur and wings. His eyes are silver, pure and unmarred by any other color. There is nothing remarkable about his tail, it is perfectly 'normal'. The only difference between his and any other's, are the lace-like scars that extend across it, seemingly made from pendragon claws. The symbol on his right haunch is a faded silver color, it's shape the ankh of egypt. Thus, it's meaning would be the same as it had been when the egyptians used it, "Key of Life"...

## Personality

If one word were need to describe him, that word would be anti-social. He hates big gatherings, and tends to avoid them as much as possible. Seeing as he has few friends, he is hardly ever invited to anything too big, which suits him well enough. The majority of his time is spent alone, by choice. Still, he is a pleasant enough pendragon when encountered, albeit a bit distant. Most consider him odd, as he seems to be distant, sometimes cold, even to friends. Those who are his friends understand, for most are like him in many ways. That is the reason he is friends with them.

## History

Arther was raised by his parents in a perfectly normal society. Surprisingly, he was their only child. Antara loved her son, and pampered him, much to the embarrassment of her husband. Meysar trained his son, and taught the young pendragon a lot of what he now knows. If it hadn't been for a tragedy, Arther may have remained a social bumbler all his life. For one reason or another, he had taken more to his father then his mother. Though he loved social gatherings at the time, he still learned all his father had to teach. When his mother died 'accidently', he was still disraught. His father, who had never been social, retreated into silence. The only pendragon he spoke to, was Arther. When his father, too, was killed, the young pendragon became secluded. While he lived in civilization, he rarely spoke to others, remaining in a stone cold shell. After a period of time, he began to be a bit more open, finding friends and enemies. That is where he is now...
