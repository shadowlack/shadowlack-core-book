## Physical description

Audace is pure white, the colour of freshly fallen snow. Her eyes are a bright but subtle pink, varying intensity within her orbs. A long back ridge of spikes runs down her back, each the same rosy pink that her eyes sport. She is adorned with rings, bracelets, necklaces, and other jewellry, all mostly made of white gold set with pink sapphires. A pair of wings lie atop her back, and each individual feather is white at the base, and blends to a dark pink at the tip, creating the effect that her wings morph from white to pink. Her tail tip, ear tips, and paws are also lined with pink, and a small pink tattoo of a margarita glass appears on her front flank.

## Personality

As her Italian inspired name implies, Audace is very bold and daring, not to mention witty, and is always up for a good adventure or trek. When not exploring, the female enjoys adding to her collection of jewellry. Her actual personality is actually slightly cold, often calculating and emotionless on a first encounter. Get to know her, however, and the shell is broken, revealing a kind pendragon with a thirst for danger and excitement. Even to good friends she is sometimes cold, but true soulmates can see through the barrier and know that she is truly not upset with them, it is merely her way of action. Upset her, and prepare never to befriend her, as this hotheaded female is not one to forgive very easily.

## History

After leading a sucessful pack-like group on a remote island, diaster struck on the community. Great storms and earthquakes sunk the magestic island, and Audace, fleeing for her life, flew from the island. Soon she grew weary and fell into the sea, to wash up on the shores of the Ramath community. Her past is slightly blurred, but many short film clips and memories still lnger in her mind. Each new day brings a new forgotten memory.
