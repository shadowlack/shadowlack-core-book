BIOGRAPHY:

Aurek is an extremely strange individual. He is actually an Anubi-Feydragon halfling. The only reason he wasn't killed as an egg is that his Feydragon father was an expert shapeshifter, and lived among the Anubi, only to be with his wife, who was a normal Anubi. Aurek's father was of the subtype Alanamsul, and came from a clan that practiced mainly pyrokinesis. On his hatchday it became clear that he was not an Anubi, and his mother was given two options: kill her son, or live in exile. She chose to live in exile of her clan and moved to Swaraj. There she lived in relative peace, she became a teacher at Janardan, passing on her knowledge of ancient Anubian history. Aurek spent his youth learning genetics as he was always wondering why he looked so different. After mastering genetics, he left Swaraj at the age of thirty to find his father. He found his father living with a large feydragon clan. Aurek spent five years living with the clan getting to know his father, and mastering pyrokinesis. Once he returned to Swaraj he decided to share his knowledge with the younger Ramathians. Once he got to the age of thirty-eight he encountered a strange strand of disease and he turned to genetic medicine and engineering, all strictly legal, no illegal cloning or anything that could land him in prison. He has recently begun rising in the social circles of Janardan.

APPEARANCE: He has the smaller frame of a feydragon, though he has the basic build of an Anubi, with red fur. He has patches of yellow on his lower arms and lower legs, both these yellow patches appear in flame patterns. His eyes appear to be normal at first glance, except that they have small hexagonal sections making them up, instead of a more commonplace eye. They look like a normal pair of eyes, except they have a glowing green color. (think your eye, except with small hexagonal breaks in them) His tail has a yellow flame on the end of it, it is a regular Anubi tail, except for the flame. His wings are draconic in appearance, and red in color, due to a recessive gene in his father's DNA. His right foot has a strange green swirl going around it. He normally wears a suit, though when in his lab he wears a white coat.
