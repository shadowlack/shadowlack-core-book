Physical Description
--------------------

Typically for the Fey, Binail (often called Bin) is short - he stands at exactly one metre in height (approx. 3"4'), slightly shorter than average for his kind. He is also more slender than not, with shoulders that could hardly be called broad. His leanness shows that he is fairly muscular, but compared to someone with a solid build he would easily lose in contests of strength; in terms of athletics, short bursts of speed are what he excels in.

On top of his head is a puff of hair which flows backwards. It ends in a peak on each side, the one on the front above his eyes and the one on the back right above his neck. His muzzle is somewhat box-shaped, and his teeth have a slight overbite, though this is only noticeable if he actually opens his mouth. Bin's ears are one of his distinguishing features; they are large and floppy, resembling those of an earthen lop-eared rabbit or a typical floppy-eared dog... except bigger, and pointed at the end. On the outside of each ear is a tattoo with a bifurcation pattern (bifurcation being a line splitting into two, then those each splitting into two, and so forth), resembling a leaf's veins and arranged to be perfectly symmetrical with each other. Indeed, one could say his ears are leaf-shaped.

Another distinguishing feature is on his arms; these are tattoos of spiralling vines. They start just beneath his shoulder blades, and wind around his upper arms three times before finishing at the elbow. Like with the ear tattoos, these are perfectly symmetrical with each other. Yet another feature is his tail. Most people would respond with, "What tail?" - his is extremely short and virtually a stump. It has no tail-flame.

Like all Feydragons, Bin has wings. His are like those of a moth, except that they are covered in a leathery skin. When not in use, they are folded against his back; they spread out and move rapidly whenever he flies. Gliding is very difficult for him, but he can hover with relative ease. Also like all Feydragons, he has a tattoo which is invisible to most; his is the symbol of his deity, the goddess Aidlt, placed right above his heart.

In terms of colours, most of Bin's body is a light muddy brown. His eyes are a bright green, whilst his hair is a light grey. All of his tattoos are a darker green, save for the symbol on his chest which is the same colour as his eyes. He is clearly an earth Alanamsul; a Child of Aidlt, the goddess of earth and biokinesis.

Personality
-----------

Binail is both a child of his clan, and a child of his time. He grew up in the cultural mix of a Feydragon clan who frequented the city of Ajita, and consequently his personality has been sculpted around it as well as his interests and hobbies.

On first meeting him, one can get the impression of someone who is friendly and laid-back, reasonably intelligent and enthusiastic about certain subjects. Indeed, Bin is a curious fellow, and should something pique his interest, he'd also be interested in learning more about it. He enjoys learning and knowledge for their own sake - to him, ignorance is not only irritating, but dangerous. This natural curiosity combined with love for learning would make him a good student... if his laid-back nature didn't include his attitude towards work! He has a terrible habit of procrastination, one that he has tried unsuccessfully to kick many times in the past.

This may be partly because he has many interests and hobbies, all of which he takes seriously. Bin doesn't want to single-mindedly focus on being one thing... he knows that the world has a lot to offer, and he wants his eyes to be open. Having studied philosophy in his own time, he sometimes thinks about the Big Questions as most would, but generally winds up dismissing them as hardly relevant to his life situation. As a consequence of his studying philosophy he is easily cynical about some religions. Some would point out that it doesn't quite work with his being a Child of Aidlt, but Bin has worked out a compromise: he sees his goddess as someone he can talk to in times of stress, and someone he can look up to. (Besides, he points out, quite a few philosophies believe in a God of sorts.)

Though just as prone to prejudice as any other, Bin tries to keep an open mind, trying to live by a simple code of "Know, Understand, Accept". And he knows all too well how this contradicts his cynicism.

This cynicism even extends to authority figures - he has an obvious lack of faith in authority, be it his clan, the Fey, or the Council. Partly due to past experiences, he is aware that they are mortal, and just as prone to mistakes as anyone else. Sometimes he has to remind himself to keep quiet on his opinions, as they have gotten him in trouble more than once.

Bin is in-between extroverted and introverted - an ambivert, who sometimes enjoys socialising and sometimes prefers solitude. He also enjoys what mainstream Ramathian society has to offer, often spending time in the city. He is and always will be part of the Fey, though... and part of nature; he holds a deep-seated love of animals, and sees them as just as important as the pendragons.

Despite his friendliness, he is generally not motivated to outstanding altruism.
