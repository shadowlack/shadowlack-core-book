## Physical description

Cassidy is a realitively small pendragon. Not tiny like [Zoar](/characters/zoar-dragyn), but a good deal shorter than most. Her fur is a pinkish purple, almost a violet-red. Her left forepaw is dipped black, one of her teacher trademarks. Around her left eye is a black patch (she was born with that one). Her hair is long and uneven. She has no hair down her back. Her hair and tail colour is an emerald green. Cassidy wears a light blue shirt and ballcap that both have the Janardan Academy logo inscribed on them. She also wears a whistle around her neck. Cassidy's tattoo is located on her left haunch; it is some form a old writing, it means *peace*.

## Personality

Cassidy is one of the softer teachers at the academy. She can be strict, but she much prefers getting to know her students, and making them work at thier own pace. Cassidy has been frowned upon by other teachers such as Fargo for not being hard enough on her students, but so far none of her pupils are slacking. One thing she is very strict about is her name. It is not Professor Cassidy to the students, it is Coach Cassidy. Once you have graduated the academy you may call her by her name. But by force of habit, most of her graduated students continue calling her Coach, and so do most of thier parents. Overall Cassidy is a warm caring teacher who would do anything for her students.

## History

Cassidy has one younger sister, Rifka (23). Her other younger sister Robyn, was lost in one of the wars. Cassidy wasn't informed of her sisters untimely death, but found out years later from [Ratha](/characters/ratharee-dragyn).
