**Appearance**

A rather burly Feydragon, he is 3'6," and is about 60 lbs. He has a light green fur, that has a tattoo on his chest of his clan, the Azetsum. His hair is rather short and whitish. His eyes are a light gray color.

**'Personality**

Cato has always had a strong, caring personality due to his type of Feydragon. From a long age, he has been seen as a strong defender and protector, so his personality shaped to it. From having healing magic, he learned how to protect people and defend them. His constant flow of people in his life also shaped him into a friendly, charismatic person. Ever since he could walk, people have always been around him. This helped him develop his charm and have many friends and lovers throughout his life. Unfortunately, he doesn't get along well with other protective people, mainly people that are protective people. He hates when people think of his size as a crutch and that he needs to be protected. Many lovers have come and gone. Men who think of him as someone who needs to be babied for never stayed for long. From the age of twenty, he had developed a nomadic type of attitude, he moved from land to land, looking for a place to call home and a lover whom he can protect. He is still like that to this day.

**History**

Cato was born to an average Swarajian family. He was the only son to two Atzetsum parents. They were very happy when their son was born and treated him like a prince for his healing magic. They sent him off to be trained from a very young age to a teacher that saw him as a prodigy. The trainer, who never told Cato his name. Taught him the healing arts and how to use weapons to protect himself. His teacher was a rather paranoid one, he always feared that Cato would be used by many in the future, so he gave him the knowledge to protect himself and a personality to push away those who may control him. This training almost made Cato hate other dominant type people, but Cato only slightly finds them annoying. He would never outwardly hate a dominant type of person, but would not be so willing to become best friends with one over night.

Even with his master's opinions and views, Cato was always happy and friendly towards everyone. His charming, charismatic nature gave him many wonderful friends whom he grew up with. Cato saw many friends come and go, going off on their own adventures and living their own lives. Cato tried to fit the mold. Under his master's guidance, he joined many armies and mercenaries, trying to use his magic to protect his new friends and teammates. He would leave many of these groups, simply because had members who would put him down because of his size. He never liked being babied for his size, so he would leave if the attitudes towards him got too extreme. He met his favorite weapon, the lance, during this time, he loves the fact that it gives him a range, making him feel taller and stronger.

After a long time and many groups left. Cato led a life of being a nomad, he continues to be a semi nomad these days, but before, he would join group to group, gain lover to lover, make friends to friends. He left after short times, seeing as no one would see him as strong or useful because of his size. This has continued for almost eleven years.

Today, He wants to quit this nomadic lifestyle, settle in with someone whom he loves and cares for, and become a healer for a town, or even join a guild of mercenaries, doing what he loves and to be accepted for it, not thought of as small or incompetent.
