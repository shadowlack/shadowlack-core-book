## Physical description

Celest has a slightly thicker build than most, but that's what makes her an expert on what she does best. Her scaled fur is a medium shade of purple, ruffled and uneven in some places. She has dark blue hair that hangs right down to her chest and a mop atop her head, all of which are tainted with light baby blue streaks. Light blue fur also outlines her elbows. Her tail is likewise long and blue, but also unkept. She has purple feathered wings that are crimson on the underside just like her mothers. Celest sometimes wears light armour around her ankles and her chest. She's rarely ever seen without a diamond shaped pendant around her neck. Her tattoo is fairly simple, a line with both beginning and end points with another line that weaves in and out on both sides. It's meaning? It just sums Celest up in all of its simplicity.

## Personality

If it wasn't for Celests mouth, she may be able to pull off as a mysterious and dangerous type. But all of her words state that she's anything but. She's carefree (or likes to pretend to be), outgoing and at times can be stupidly funny. One of her major flaws is that she has a short attention span and often forgets the task at hand. (A flaw that's caused her to be frowned upon as a messenger.) One of her trademarks is using her limited telepathic abilities to blow up small flying creatures over other pendragons heads. It's just a little morbid. Despite her rather flighty attitude at times, she can get rather serious, that is, if she can remember what she's supposed to be being serious about.

## History

Celest has always been on the move ever since she was little. Her parents being the only living pendragons that were a current threat to the Graders reign has made her life  slighty more difficult than some others. The Graders were always sending her parents, the Senecas, on dangerous away missions in hopes that one day they wouldn't return. So far they haven't been successful. Because of this Celest struck out on her own as did her much younger brother. She got accepted into some sort of private organization (which she won't talk about) that took residence on another planet. The only information that's she has revealed about it is that the gravity was quite a bit stronger there. Once when she was back in Ramath-lehi, teaching, she met Terez Dragyn. How this happened no one really knows. She ended up having his son, Mezzo Dragyn. Yet she couldn't stay rooted down to a family just yet. So she left them, leaving the unknowing Mezzo in the care of his father. She still wonders if this chapter of her life was a mistake.
