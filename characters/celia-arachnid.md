## Physical description

A white pelt adorns the female Celia, the soft hair spikes on her chest and neck tapering black as if dipped in liquid onyx. Hey eyes are draconic in nature, slices of black slits in deep pools of grey. The large black tattoo of a spider traces her left flank, along with a pair of smaller arachnids which reside on her left paw. Her entire body is coated with faint grey traces of woven spiderwebs, in sizes ranging from paw-size to the size of her regal head. Often her paws, the pads black and firm, leave behind small spider webs behind, occasionally even a small arachnid-like creature, but of course no true spiders inhabit the planet. 

## Personality

Celia is often rather cold and calculating, not laughing at jokes or smiling in any way except her trademark cold sneer. She is not evil, however, or even misjudged. The female simply takes her jobs seriously, as neither the art of math nor the science of archaeology leave room for jokes and games. Celia takes her jobs very seriously. Seriously. Though if you do anger her, watch out, for you may find yourself in a web of spider-silk, though none have angered her enough to breach her inner limits. Yet. Of course, she could simply torture you with endless speeches about the Chaos Theory instead...

## History

Ungrateful parents bore Celia, not caring about her suprisingly vast knowledge of mathematics and archaeology. Quite simply, she injured the pair of them and left, the only trace of her leave a small spiderlike creature, who cast upon her the patterns of webs on her pelt and carved the great spider tattoo on her flank.
