## Physical description

Cirrus is a pendragon of very thin build, roughly the length and height of an adult male wolf, but much lighter. He is extremely skinny, though quite strong considering his stature. The male's pelt is pure white, though pale blue spirals adorn Cirrus' entire body, turning into bands as they reach his slender tail. A small raised section of his left flank shows a small fluffy cloud, referring to air and the act of being carefree. Cirrus has half a dozen long furry spikes on his forehead and upper back, each roughly a foot long in length, though one is nearly two. These spikes are sky blue in colour, very pale at the base and gradually darker as they lengthen.

## Personality

Alike to his parents' branding, Cirrus is extremely carefree, turning to the clouds and nature for advice. While preferring not to mingle in crowds, he still enjoys the company of another, however. As Cirrus is so carefree and as some say it, happy-go-lucky, the male is extremely hard to anger, but as everything is balanced, the pendragon will never forgive once anyone breaches his tolerance.

## History

The Reil line of pendragons is a rather old one, each member bearing the name of a type of cloud, eventually passing down names as time progressed and varieties of clouds ran out. As most of his family tree had stocky bodies and strong builds, Cirrus was an insulting oddity of the family, and took to the fact that he would never gain any friends within his clan. Instead, he remained in the area, but walked among the serpents and the crows. Their company was much more satisfactory than his siblings, so he stayed there, much to the delight of the Reils. After living in the wild with his animal companions, he soon taught himself the languages of the birds and snakes, eventually befriending a female raven, Windvoice. Cirrus wandered with his avian companion and stumbled on Ramath-lehi, conversing with serpents and birds along the way.
