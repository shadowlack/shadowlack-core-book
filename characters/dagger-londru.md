## Physical description

He is an average sized pendragon, about 5'6 at the shoulder, he has deep blue eyes that glow with an internal flame of rebellion. He has a thin mane of aqua blue fur running from the back of his head down to the shoulders, the rest of his fur is an almost blood red color with jagged yellow lightning stripes down his back and limbs, his tail is more of a green color with bits of red in it. His tail flame is a deep, hot, red mixed in with bits of yellow and bright green. Recently, it has burned redder with the death of his family.

## Personality

One word describes him, an angry rebel trying to overthrow the current power. (okay, it's not one word, but you get the idea)

## History

He was a happy student at the [Kyorall University](/schools/kyorall-university) until a few years ago when the Graders took power and the period of opresssion began and many were bieng killed. He already had a view against the Graders, until his parents were killed in some kind of coup and there was no reason for his family to be attacked as they were not that influential, it was then that he turned rebel and his cry became, Rebellion!
