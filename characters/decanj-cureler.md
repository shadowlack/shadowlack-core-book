She was the pioneer for modern virus playing. Early in the history of the game, her opponents found themselves stumped at how she was able to beat almost every player who fought her without so much as breaking a sweat. Upon inspection of one of her cards various strange strands of code where found that seemed to serve no purpose but to take up space. For a while this was disregarded and she continued to play the way she did, even winning a couple of Menlo Competitions Corporation Official matches. Then one of her viruses went a little overboard and cut off all power to one of her opponent's suits just as the game began.

They discovered that she had been using strands of code that disrupted various parts of the game and was banned from any further MCC competitions and state of the art virus blockers and scanners where installed in all of the MCC Arena equipment. Though her original codes where never shared with any one, others were able to create their own once they were aware such a thing could be done. She is the mother to the modern way of virus playing and opened up an entirely new aspect to the game.
