Draco's fur is a fairly dark red, with black paws and black stripes down his back and tail. He has two stripes across his nose, and one behind each ear. The symbol on his haunch is of the constellation, draco (the dragon), and it means 'look to the stars'. Around his eyes are thick, black, crescent moons and he has earned all four of his 'stripes'. His hair is a light blueish-grey colour, and runs half way down his back. Draco has feathery wings that are a blueish-green. And at the very end of his tail, hidden by flame is a sort of cupped claw formation that is able to give enemies a sharp pinch, or if closed, a harsh blow.

## Personality

Draco has a very outgoing personality. Often unpredictable and sometimes just plain weird, he is one of the reasons the Dragyn name means what it does. Draco may seem to be the life of the party, even when there is no party, but his past romance life has crippled him, and left him grief stricken for his deceased wife, Robyn. But his childish attitude and strong will keeps his real emotions hidden from the world.

## History

Draco has a twin brother, Lorax, and an older brother Terez. He is practically attached at the hip with Lorax, and avoids Terez with his life on the line. He has one daughter, Naka, whom he used to be very close with until her mother passed away. And he has two sons, to whom the mother is still unknown. His parents were 'killed' in an explosion when Draco was only a pup, hence the Graders stepped in after Thanos and Sari. Draco has his suspicions, but would never think of accusing the Graders of his parents death. That would be very bad...
