## Physical description

Dragonis is green with blue paws, a blue muzzle and blue ears. His 'hair' is black with light green and blue highlights. Around his paws are anklets made of chains, his left ear is pierced three times while his right is pierced only once. Burned into his left haunch is a single black flame, supposedly standing for his firey attitude.

## Personality

I can sum it all up in one word: Anger.

## History

He has never told anyone of his past history as a child, so therefore its unknown, but I do know of his recent history. At a strangely young age his parents kicked him out of the clan to be on his own, before he finished his schooling. He found a home amoung a kindly clan,  that helped him finish his schooling, and there he fell in love with Orella. Orella was unusually skinny and somewhat weak for a pendragon. Dragonis dreamt of having a son to teach and to hunt with. However, Orella had a girl: Izzeria. Angry and upset, Dragonis refused to speak to both Izzy and Orella. Orella died a few days later, for the effort of childbirth had broken her frail body, and illnesses swept upon her like a tidel wave. From then on, Dragonis has been roaming.
