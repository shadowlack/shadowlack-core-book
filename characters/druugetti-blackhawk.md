## Physical description

A female of mass physique, larger than an average male and brutal to a fault. Rippling, masculine muscles impress beneath hide of dark orange. Turquoise freckles spot the area 'neath her ebony eyes, down her muzzle, over her shoulders, hips, along her tail and spattered down her limber legs. Cinnamon hair is wild and unruly, matched only by her temperment. Vivacious curls are rarely held back. A purple ring is worn on each thick thumb, hued to match her unforgettable tattoos. Fingertips are white, as are her ear- and tail-tips. Sparse, elegant whiskers sprout from the end of her elongated upper lip, which is rarely without a sneer.

## Personality

Artistic, intelligent, thoughtful and outwardly loyal. But there is still much to be feared. This pendragon has been compared to fire; a raging temper, yet often comforting and helpful through its danger. Electricity, for she is uncontrollable and feirce, but useful if harnessed. Water, because the surges of rage and wild fury are often surpassed by her calm and flowing exterior. Like cinnamon, her personality ranges from sweet to spicy. Bossy, contradictory and always on top, Druugetti finds no trouble in making some.

## History

Her father was a quiet politician, lurking where he may. But things were to change when he met a formidable opponent - his one true love. She turned him against his own beliefs and then led the unsuspecting Gyro on a wild escape from the confines of society. Eventually murdered at the hands of the Graders, the wild fling soon ended and Gyrospect lived his life under penalty of lawbreaking. Little did he know that a child had been sired to him - Druugetti had been unleashed upon the world.
