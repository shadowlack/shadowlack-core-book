## Physical description

Smaller than the average Pendragon, Etincelle looks frail and innocent. Nobody knows why she always has a sad expression on her face. Her fur is of a light blueish grey, her chest is snow white and she has deep blue eyes, wings and a spiral like mark on her forehead. She wears a heavy golden bracelet,  necklace and a sort of chain with a little blue gem which is tied behind her head. 

## Personality

Though she may look fragile and weak, Etincelle isn't. Only when she is angered or bullied will she show her true colours. She is very quitet and  discrete. She has a very good memory and will remember anything that may be used against someone and is ready to betray her closest friends for her own sake. She is smart and will pretend to be friendly till the very end.

## History

Etincelle only knows her parents by their name and doesn't know what happened to them. She is a spy is willing to do any job as long as the reward is worth it. She has never been found out and hopes she never will.
