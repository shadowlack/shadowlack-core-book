## Physical description

Length-wise, Ghost is the size of a small cheetah: 112 cm. Nevertheless, his legs and tail aren't quite in proportion. With a shoulder height of 92 cm and a tail span of 93 cm, he gives the impression of being underfed, when he's simply rather lanky. His fur is a very dark blue, and painfully well groomed. The spikes flowing down the youth's back are short, only about three inches high, though give the impression off scales. This all ends at his forehead, where three or four locks, thirty centimeters long, hang over his blue eyes. There are also short spikes of hair on his heals. The flame on his tail is nearly always a bright yellow, indicating his love for happiness. The tattoo on his right haunch depicts a symbol meaning "lunacy". The symbols and spiking hair are a bright orange, as well as his additional thumbs. There is only one more thing to mention about this young male: he's biorganic, meaning half-animal, half-machine. Instead of veins he has wires. Instead of a harddrive, he has a brain. This being the case, the flame on his tail contains iron, nickel, and other metals; much like the planet's inner core. 

## Personality

The male's life revolves around one word: mischeif. He can rarely be seen not causing any trouble, spending his days chasing innocent creatures or harassing his elders, be it the lowest ranking pendragon or the Graders. Ghost loves to dance, as well as taking risks. To feed this devil-may-care attitude, he isn't especially loyal as most. Some may call this dishonorable, but frankly, he couldn't care less.

## History

Ghost can recall nothing of his past, but a reasonable explanation to his creation is as follows. Scientists wanted a war machine, one that could destroy everything in its path. Evidently, something went wrong. Instead of the heartless tool they had planned for, they came up with a cheerful and seemingly harmless pet. Confused and angry, they etched the hateful symbols on to his side, before tossing him away. Literally. The only thing Ghost can remember is being stranded in a heap of the remains of once working gears and metal parts. This didn't perturb him, and with a brave shrug the lonely child dramatically mounted his trusty steed, who reared up into the darkening sky before galloping off into the glorious sunset while wolves howled in the distance and eagles soared magestically overhead and mountains loomed. Except not really.
