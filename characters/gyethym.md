Gyetym is large and muscular with deep, golden eyes. His hair is light blue, falling across his face most of the time. His chest and stomach are covered with hard gray scales, while the rest of his body has short, pure white fur.

Gy's tail is long, with a pale blue fire on the tip. His wings are leathery, white, and very big. He stands at about 6 foot 3 inches. His claws are dark gray, almost black. Through one bat-like ear he has two silver hoops.

Gy usually wears jeans, but no shirt. He likes to feel the wind on his chest and, whenever he's away from civilization, he prefers not wearing anything at all.

Personality
-----------

Gyetym is very protective of his secrets, and prefers being alone. If you manage to become his friend, he protects you for life. On the outside, he is mean and often gets into fights. He doesn't like it when people pick on him, and has a tendency to hit first and talk later.

When you get to know him, Gy is pretty cool. He enjoys talking to people and making new friends, but many stay away from him. He likes taking care of children when he's allowed to, and makes up stories to keep them entertained.
