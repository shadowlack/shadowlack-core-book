## Personality

Hawke, by nature, has always been an outcast. She perfers to be by herself then around others. She rarely has a kind word to spare for anyone. She is also 'not right in the head'. She mumbles to herself and complains about voices  that plaque her day and night. Often she'll scream out randomly and twitch. Her abnormal behavior is the soul reason behind her hateful-ness. She can't stand being around others, and she has a horrible temper. She is unafraid to strike out or 'do what the voices tell her'. She can't imagine a life with friends, or a mate. She has no memory of her past history, nor what accident caused her to become slightly insane. She perfers to curl up in a dark tunnel, muttering insanely to herself, then to be out in the sunshine around others.

## History

Hawke knows nothing of her history, but i know some to tell. She was born a normal pendragon. Her parents showered her in love, until one day they both were murdered before her very eyes. She was so young, that this caused her to become confused, and later insane. The other pendragons were wary of this insane orphan. Finally, Hawke disapeared one late night, off on her own. Her family clan has never seen her since. The believed she had killed herself. She stumbled upon a new clan of pendragons, and there she recieved schooling, and despite her insanity she was found to have a knack at making potions and another at fighting. She exelled in both of these subjects.
