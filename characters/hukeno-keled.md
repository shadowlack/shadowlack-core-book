All about .

A member of the Bounty Hunters Guild. Somewhat short for a Khell, but he has the burly physique that his race is known for. Unsurprisingly he often uses his physical prowess in combat, but he also wears enchanted armour, both to protect himself and make his attacks hit harder.

Outside of the armour, his fur has colours and patterns not unlike those of a tortoiseshell cat, with a touch of Siamese for his face. He likes eating fish.
