## Physical description

Hype is slightly taller than a medium-sized Pendragon, but his figure is somewhat lanky, seeing as how he doesn't eat much. His hair is always kept neatly trimmed, so as to keep it out of the way, though a couple of small, scattered spikes always end up jutting out just above his eyes. His off-white pelt is speckled with silver, fading to a darker gray at the top of his head, and eventually to pitch-black at the tips of his ears and locks. A similar pattern occurs at his tail, limbs, and the crippled wings upon his back, crooked and ugly, the feathers lacking the smooth glossy look to the rest of   him. The tail is long and nimble, like a monkey's, and so Hype often ends up using it as an extra limb. His eyes are mismatched, the left being an earthly green and the right being a stormy blue, conveying feelings of serenity and chaos, respectively. This typically gives his face a strange look to it, at least when he's facing you directly. 


## Personality

There was never another whose name did not fit him as much as Hype did not fit Hype Ryans. If one were to look up 'hype' in the dictionary, they would find that it typically means stimulation, exaggeration, or a drug addict. Now, Hype Ryans /could/ be mistaken for a drug addict, but the only reason why was because he lacked any stimulation what so ever. He wouldn't break a sweat if a 200-pound axe were hurtling towards him, his heart rate would not increase if he were being flung off a bridge at 80 miles per hour, and his breathing would remain normal if he happened to be dragging his bowels behind him on the way to the nearest hospital. Ok, so that was slightly exaggerated. However, one can be assured, that Hype is not a drug addict at all. In fact, he is one of the most sober characters on hand, a trait that is all but necessary to his particular line of work. Hype isn't too cold or too friendly, he doesn't dislike anyone until he has a reason to, and doesn't call someone friend until he has a /good/ reason to. However, he does recognize those who have had a certain impact on his life, and will offer a casual smile or meaningful glance should he happen to come across someone he is particularly close to. While it is true that some pendragons have crossed to omnivores, Hype manages to take this to a fault, unhealthily attracted to things that aren't good for him. (read crap food) This might explain his shifty style in combat, preferring to just dodge and try to make an escape than actually fight. The good thing about this is that he's become rather good at it, the bad is that this means his attacks are average to weak. A couple of subjects do exist that he becomes rather touchy about, his useless wings being one of them. And finally, he's very into his business, playing it like he's got nothing to lose, and, ironically, this approach seems to work. Hype specializes in a variety of cons, but excels best at taking roles and acting them out truthfully. In other words, a Damn Fine Liarï¿½.

## History

Felicia and Atomos Ryans did not die tragic deaths that left Hype scarred for life, nor did they abuse or be terribly unfair towards him. He didn't run away, and he didn't become separated from his family. He simply chose not to live with them one day, in his adolescence, and walked out. And he kept walking. In his travels, Hype did meet up with a good variety of con artists, both learning from and getting cheated by them (though, in the latter case, he did learn as well). Since he had no education in any other field, Hype found himself just dropped into the business, and before he was aware of it, he could carry on a conversation and steal someone's wallet at the same time. This scared, amused, befuddled, but above all, excited him. Through his early career, he did go through a couple of partnerships, and managed to land a few big scams, enough to live on, anyways. The only time he ever did hear from his parents again, was when he received word that his mother was pregnant again. This little bit of news, however, did not interest him much, and to this day, he still doesn't really care about what happened to them. Hype is still young, though, and at times, reckless. He has never been in love, and hopes never to be, for he heard that it sucks from the brain to fuel the heart.
