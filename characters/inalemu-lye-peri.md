All about .

A member of the Bounty Hunters' Guild. Lye Peri doesn't like to talk about his/her past or private life, to the point that s/he hasn't even revealed if s/he's male, female or something else - s/he often conceals his/her appearance and uses a voice modulator to make it hard to tell. All that's known is that s/he is an Anubi, and judging from the name and what little people have seen of him/her actual appearance, s/he may not be a purebred one.

Lye Peri wears full-body enchanted armour, complete with a mask and a cloak. S/he usually avoids direct violence outside of knocking targets unconscious, but if a fight breaks out, s/he will use his/her main weapon: a shield.
