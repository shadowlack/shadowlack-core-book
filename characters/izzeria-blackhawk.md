## Physical description

Izzeria is completely white with orange markings. Her muzzle, ears, and paws look as if they were dipped in orange ink. There is a circle of orange around her right eye. her spikey 'mohawk' hair is also orange, with black tips. Her tail has rings of orange around it. One eye is orange, the other green. On her spine is one long orange slash, ending at the base of her tail.

## Personality

She has a temper, very quick to anger. She cares not for children, and rarely cares about anyone but herself. However, if she ever does have friends, she will be fiercly loyal to them. She's restless, and can sometimes be very cold-hearted and merciless. Just like any other normal person, she can make mistakes too.

## History

She was born to Orella Kartys and Dragonis Blackhawk. Her history isn't much, because it isn't filled with horrible pasts, bloody murders or hate. It was quite boring. Her father, slightly upset that she wasn't a boy, never really got close to her and often tried to push her away. Her mother, in apologies for her father's dislike towards her, often tried to shower her daughtor in gifts and love, which caused Izzy some discomfort. Izzy's mother taught her  to hunt at a young age, in hopes to impress her father, and ever since then she's been learning and improving that skill. She's also taken up spying, because her slim body and light paws make her perfect for being invisible when she wants to be.  That is pretty much it for Izzy.
