## Physical description

Jargon, in size, isn't much different than the average *arden*. His build is quite different though. Rather than being built heavy with muscles (as his father would have preferred), Jargon is rather light-weighted and streamlined for flight. He possesses great dark green feathered wings mixed with blue and black. His pelt colour is a soft medium grey. Red "socks" run up all of his legs and end right above the elbow joints. He usually wears dark blue two piece cuffs with a smooth design over his wrists. Jargon has somewhat of a black facial mask that runs from the top of his muzzle all the way back to his ears, his tail is also partially black, ending with twin flat blades. Jargons hair is a golden blonde, it tapers over his nose and follows the length of his back. His symbol is a four coloured rainbow being consumed by darkness. Faded blue, almost white eyes complete his wholesome appearance.

## Personality

Jargon has always been soft spoken. But then again, why speak when you know you'd only be mocked for it? For as long as he can remember, he's always had a speech impediment. He stammers, leaves out whole words, and even sometimes locks up completely. Jargon hass been working diligently on this problem, and many of his friends would most likely say that they've noticed a great improvement.

## History

Born an optimist, Jargon always looked on the "sunny side" of life. Even when his parents continually tried to block up his life with rain and clouds. Jargon attended school for many terms in a private facility. But after one rather severe incident, he transferred to [Janardan](/schools/janardan-academy) and continued his schooling there. (Much to his fathers disapproval) Things couldn't have gone better for him though. There he met [Naka Dragyn](/characters/naka-dragyn). She didn't ridicule him like most others would... and what started as a fast friendship eventually blossomed into much more. Now Jargon finds himself often "in over his head" along with the [Dragyn](/genealogy/dragyn) clan, but he wouldn't give it up for anything.
