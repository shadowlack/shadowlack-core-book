## Physical description

Jecht has coarse fur on his head and on his bib which is a tan colour. His eyebrows are also tan, and same with is paws. The rest of his fur is a wee bit more fine. Jecht's symbol is of a dragon with it's wings curled around in a cresent moon shape. Jecht wears a metal arrow shaped charm around his neck held up by a chain. He has lopsided bangs, and his fur/hair sticks out on each side of his head. Jecht doesn't have a tail, but more of a nub. No one is really sure that he ever had a tail. Jecht is on the lighter side for a pendragon of his size and age. His mid section is quite thin, but his legs are a little more thickened. Jecht's ears and nose are out of proportion with the rest of his body, his nose being short like a cat's and his ears being quite large.

## Personality

Jecht doesn't have much of a personality. He isn't the brightest individual, but he has a heart of gold. Jecht usually doesn't say much, but when he does, it's usually delayed or off topic. He shows appreciation to anyone that is kind to him, and smiles politely to those who are not.

## History

When most pendragons are hatched, the egg explodes with a burst of flame. Not Jecht's egg. He calmly broke open his shell, and fell asleep half way through the process. A few years later his mother abandoned him at the Janardan Academy, (not wanting to embrace the fact that her son was less than perfect). He was taken in by Cassidy Savarally, who had just begun her teaching career.
