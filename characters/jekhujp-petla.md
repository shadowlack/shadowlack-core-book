Jékhujp is old, and wise. However, he does not appear to be aged. He doesn’t look a shade over forty. This in itself is pretty remarkable, but this male’s most outstanding feature is his height. He stands over seven feet tall, causing him to tower over the majority of the population. He is very thin, but his frame is more often than not hidden by thick, flowing robes. His face, which is likewise thin, is often shadowed by a hood, but his crystal blue eyes can never be hidden – they sparkle and dance no matter what. As for Jekhujp’s coloration, he is a silver color, with a sort of icy tint to his fur. Even his tail flame is a frigid blue, like a living icicle.

Personality
-----------

Just like Jékhujp does not look his age, he also does not act like a wizened elder. In fact, he is quite sprightly, and loves to crack jokes. He is very in tune with the younger generations, which is the main reason that has led him to help in Adfesmatt traditions. He makes people comfortable in any situation, and always has a hug or a smile to offer to someone in need. He is often regarded by his young followers as an additional uncle, or perhaps grandfather, a pendragon that anyone can go to talk about anything. Anyone can relate to him, and he is more than willing to lend a listening ear and a helping hand.

History
-------

Jékhujp p’Etla – “Richard of the Isle” – was born on a small island off the coast of Boreios Sudesha. The pendragons that lived upon this tiny isle were part of a tightly knit society, and their main focus in life was religion and spiritualism. In fact, Jékhujp was born to the second most important arden in the civilization – the Takympuji p’Etla. The Takympuji, who was known not by his own name but by his position, was the leader of all ritualistic religious ceremonies on the island, and he was held in great esteem. Consequentially, Jékhujp was also revered. Even before he was old enough to speak, he was apprenticed in his father’s arts of seerism and religion. When he was old enough to make decisions for himself, he embraced these trades, and over the course of many decades, became a very powerful seer and religious master. The only time his faith ever faltered was when his father died, but Jékhujp struggled and finally regained his spirituality. However, unable to remain on the island where his father had been secondary leader, and where he was destined to become the next Takympuji, Jékhujp fled to mainland Swaraj to become a sort of missionary seer. His most common calling nowadays is to help with stages of the Adfesmatt fastening tradition.
