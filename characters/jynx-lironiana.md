Jynx is black with pale blue hair with gray streaks and bright blue eyes. Her nose is long, resembling a canine , and her tail looks like an arrowhead on the end. Her claws are gray, and she has a scar going vertically down her left eye, ending above her cheek. The flesh around and in the scar is red, as if it were given to her recently.

Jynx's eyes are very bright and expressive. Her face is thin, like a cat. She has leathery dragon wings. The skin covering the bone that connects the wing to her is black, while in between is gray. Her voice always sounds as if she is singing.

Personality
-----------

Jynx enjoys looking out for others. She is not afraid to stand up for herself or get in a fight to protect an innocent. She is kind to others when they are kind to her. She would rather get hurt than see someone else be harmed.

Jynx is also very optimistic. Though her life has been hard, she always sees the brighter side of life. There is very little that makes her feel unwanted or uncared for. She is very loving, and willing to take care of anyone who asks her for help. She's a very outgoing person, but on a rare ocassion she can become very shy.
