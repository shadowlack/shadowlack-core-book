## Physical description

Kaji is a 14 year old female Pendragon. She's about 5'6" tall and weighs approx. 140 lbs. Her scales are a mottled orange-brown color and she has deep gold hair. Her eyes are a soft cyan shade, but when she uses her telepathic powers they turn a cool, piercing shade of silver. Of course she only reads when she thinks someone is in danger.

## Personality

Kaji is a very loyal friend, but she isn't like others. She's an outsider, watching quietly from the sidelines. She doesn't speak unless spoken to, but she isn't shy. When with Pendragons she knows she's very hyper and talkative.

## History

Kaji was born on the small island of Bhim. At the age of three a great famine struck and all others fled, but at the time Kaji was ill and could not swim to safety, if you could say so. Many of the other dragons drowned from the exhaustion of swimming so long, so far. Kaji learned to rely on herself at an early age, so she is an independent creature. Recently the dragons returned, and Kaji is finding her roots.
