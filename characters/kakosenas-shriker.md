Known widely as the alleged killer of [Karryasa Grader](/characters/karryasa-grader), Kakosenas seems to fit the very definition of a criminal. She was accused by Koani Grader of opening a one way portal to the Nothing, which Karryasa Grader was then consumed by. Unfortunately no proof was procured in order to support this claim. Koani was forced to drop the case, and as a result, Kakosenas got off free.
