Kalar Pym Vie is an author and comic book writer. She is most famous for her work with Larr Svulieon *The White Vajjas*, a graphic novel series; her other works include *Twenty-Nine Nights* and *Lightning That Can't Strike* (working with artist JL Bekel for both of these). Pym Vie's style involves heavy use of metafiction, as well as constant use of complex, overarching plotlines.
