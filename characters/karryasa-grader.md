**Karryasa Jolten Grader** (Dyo 32, 81272 â€“ Mia 48, 81378) was the reigning Arch Magosai of Ramath-lehi between the years 81343 and 81378.

Karryasa was widely known and feared for her mental prowess. From a young age it was apparent that her ties to Fronima were immensely strong and that she had off the chart mental capabilities. These mental abilities ranged widely, from simple Telepathy and Telekinesis, to more manipulative abilities such as suggestion and puppetry.

- A common rumour is that Karryasa was controlling her husband, [Zamfir Grader](/characters/zamfir-grader) with her telepathic abilities.
- The late Sari Zeb Dragyn was also believed to have talked to Karryasa in her sleep, haunting her.
- It was also rumoured that she could see directly into Fronima with her maimed left eye.

Karryasa's exact lineage is unknown. It wasn't until she abruptly began dating Zamfir Grader that she started to become noticed. It is believed that she was just a simple commoner with a modest background. Her only known relative was a winged thill by the name of Lauren Jolten. Karryasa had eleven children with Zamfir: [Koani](/characters/koani-grader), Alice, Josie, Shag, Lupus, Sean, Ryan, Rodney, Tyotie, Sara, and Rachelle.

On Mia 48, 81378, Karryasa met her untimely end. It was reported that her physical being was thrust into the *Nothing* and that a fragment of her mind was split off into Fronima. Shortly after Karryasa's death, [Kakosenas Shriker](/characters/kakosenas-shriker) was accused and charged of the murder by Koani Grader. However, evidence was not produced on time and the charges were dropped. Regardless of the exact circumstances, Karryasa's presence on Ramath-lehi came to an end.

## Physical description

Karryasa isn't as large as one might think she would be at her age. She is big, but not overly. Her hair is very uneven and matted. It runs from the top of her head to about half way down her back, around her neck and chest, and also at the base of her tail. Her mid-section dosn't have this tatted fur because of the bandages wrapped around her ribs. Her hair a royal blue, without any signs of aging. The rest of her fur is a deep purple. Her tail isn't like most pendragons. Instead of taking on a wolfish shape, it looks more like the tail of a chinchilla. Furry and long, with a tuff on the end. Her tail is also purple, but has a hint of blue in the tip. Karryasas canine teeth are quite long, and remain visable even when her mouth is shut. But her most famous characteristic is her eyes. Instead of being a bright yellow, they are a deep orange. Over her left eye are four deep gauges that were unmistakably made by another pendragon. She also has a bite mark on her right foreleg. Her left foreleg is bandaged aswell as her midsection. Karryasas last trademark is her necklace. It is simply a piece of string with various sized claws strung along it. Upon closer inspection, one would realize that those claws were indeed pendragon claws.  ....sorry forgot to mention that her left ear is also torn to shreds.

## Personality

Karryasa is not the most sociable pendragon one could come across. She would much rather be alone or with one or two family members, not a crowd. On the rare occation that Karryasa goes looking for company, she is either avoided out of fear, or confronted by the most annoying sort of pendragons with the most boring and or ridiculous problems that they figure the crippled old Grader could solve for them. And more often than not she meets up with *so to speak* with an assassin or two. Nothing she can't handle. Not many pendragons that have ill intentions towards the Graders get close to Karryasa. She sences them before smell, and has them in pieces before sight.

## History 

Karryasas husband is Zamfir. She has eleven children. Koani, Alice, Josie, Shag, Lupus, Sean, Ryan, Rodney, Tyotie, Sara, and Rachelle. She has a sister, whom she secretly envies because Lauren was blessed with wings. 

Karryasa is indeed a crippled pendragon. She cannot walk very well and when she does it is quite slow and painful. But she has her good days and her bad days. Not many pendragons are aware of the truth about how Karryasa became crippled, so she allows them to make up false rumours so they don't seek the truth. But just because Karryasa is disabled does not by all means mean that she fights handicapped. Her battles rage through you mind. Any false moves around Karryasa could mean she makes you fight yourself, a conflict that would be imposible to win. Karryasas major flaw is that she believes that she needs no help, from anyone. It's rumoured that the late Sari contacts Karryasa in her sleep to give her advice and receive updates, but these rumours have never been justified. Just like the rumours about Karryasa's left eye. Some believe that with it she can peer into the spirit world. Than again, others simply believe that the eye is merely blind. The thing about Karryasa is that she allows the public to believe what they want, and she keeps the truth to just about her whole life to herself.
