**Kjoz** (pronounced *kawz*) is the pseudonym of a highly established erotica writer known for her witty and literate prose, tasteful imagery, darker undertones and use of puns. Kjoz's slow rise to fame began in 81349 with the publication of her first novel, *U Fempyf't Guma*. Since then she has published roughly two books (sometimes more) per year. For years the public has wondered just who the real face behind the name is, yet Kjoz chooses to remain completely anonymous. While she has on several occasions leaked a few tidbits of information out about herself, the facts are presumed to be a joke and are purposely vague.
