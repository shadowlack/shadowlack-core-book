One of the "local bosses" in [Bhim](/countries/bhim "wikilink"). Donvosti is a Myshemd Feydragon; he was exiled from his clan after attempting to murder a member of the clan's Court. Since then he has led a bloody life which ultimately led to him founding a crime group. His group is largely focused on technology.

He is a heavy smoker, wears an eyepatch, and uses handguns and rapiers.
