Kuma is a slim, muscled 'dragon. He's tall, around 6'4 or 6'5, and has plain black hair that follows his spine to the base of his tail. His ears are that of a cat. He has almond shaped eyes that have no color, and although he can see perfectly well he looks like he's blind. His face is sharp and narrowed, like a cat's.

Kuma's fur is short, with abstract coloring. He has patches of blue, red, and green of every shade covering his body, with no pattern at all. He was born without wings and he has an extra pair of arms that grow just below his rib cage.

Personality
-----------

Kuma is extremely helpful and kind, but he can be a little lazy at times. He enjoys spending time with a few other people, but he isn't a social creature. He's very quiet and subdued, and hardly ever speaks out unless with close friends or family. Kuma is always trying to make other people happy.

History
-------

Kuma started playing the doesuj when he was five, and has played ever since. Most of the time he played whatever came to mind, putting together random chords to make something beautiful. His parents sent him to Dragonbach's Musical Academy when he was six, where he met [Sarah Gojgla](/Sarah_Gojgla "wikilink").
