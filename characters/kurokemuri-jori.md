Kurokemuri –or just Ku- is of an average build for a Yki male. Slim and lithe, he is leanly muscular, while still retaining an almost under-weight appearance. His chest is deep, but his waist is thin, giving him the stark contrast that leads many to believe that he is emaciated. His legs are slightly longer than the average Yki’s, but not so much that he appears disproportionate. His head follows the standard vulpine build for his breed, a narrow muzzle and a domed skull toped by a pair of large, triangular ears. He is built for speed and agility, and as such is not overly strong or powerful, but has an almost unmatchable stamina.

He was one kit in a litter of two, both males and both of them manifesting the black base coat. In regards to his markings, he takes after his mother. The markings are a bright blue-purple, occasionally lightening to a fuchsia tone in the correct lighting. Each paw is dipped in this color, as well as his the end of his tail and the tips of his ears. There are two wide, tapering stripes of this same color on each of his shoulders, extending from the center of his back to his elbows.

Ku’s bladed hair falls to the right side of his face in a series of soft quills, stiff enough that it can stand erect on its own if kept the correct length, but worn too long to do so. This same bladed hair follows his spine in a horse-like mane, starting where his hair stops and ending between his shoulder blades. The hair is of an identical hue to his markings, although there is a slight striped pattern between the tones of purple, alternating between more a bluish purple to that of a pinker hue. His visible eye is solid red, with a tiny slit pupil. He is missing his right eye, as well as a large portion of his cheek. Angry red scars, deep and unsightly, marr this part of his face, where an enemies jaws seemed to have clamped down onto his muzzle.

His base coat color is black, although when under direct lighting conditions it appears more of a deep charcoal black. If one looks very carefully, and if the light is hitting him in just the right way, faint markings are visible on his pelt. The pattern is very similar to that of a jungle cat, such as a leopard or a jaguar, and the small, erratically shaped spots are arranged in loose, horizontal ‘rows’. These markings are barely a shade lighter than the rest of his coat, and blend in almost perfectly with the surrounding color, but are most visible on his haunches. Why the markings are there is unknown, but if he had been born with a white coat they may very well have been where his purple marks showed up on his coat.

Personality
-----------

Kurokemuri could be stereotyped as the sullen, anti-social type, although the term isn’t quite accurate. He grew up hard and fast, seeing more of the bad side of people than the good. As such, he swiftly became hardened; learning that to give someone his trust to readily could prove hazardous, or even fatal. There are times when he can be friendly, even jovial; as time goes on he is learning that not everyone wants to hurt him, or has an ulterior motive for kind words or behaviors.

Those who aren’t knowledgeable enough to recognize his nature as suspicion often label him as a selfish bastard, or even a narcissist, thanks to the fact he enjoys his own company more than being with others. When Ku does come across a pendragon that has a personality similar to his own, he often becomes good friends with them, willing to lay his own life on the line for their safety and well-being.
