## Physical description

Laiu is a wolf-looking creature. Her pelt is a very dark midnight blue. On her coat are strips of golden yellow, while on her paws are dips of orange. She has orbs of amber and the average size of dragon wings. A flicker of icy fire floats around on the tip of her tail, used as a defence against the ones who bother her.  Her silver metallic claws are always out, leaving deep marks in the terra which she walks on.

## Personality

Laiu can be very agressive, and sometimes rude towards others. Jealousy can happen to her very often, when watching the others from afair. She enjoys tracking others, and maybe even play fighting. Like I said, when she becomes aggressive, keep away. She can really be mean at that time. If you befriend her (Which is pretty hard) you'll have a friend for life.

## History

Born on the coast of Swaraj, Laiu has learned to feind for herself. She only knew her parents for very little time, until they were killed. She had one brother. he was much older than her, and didn't even look like he was part of the family. Laiu scraped for food like a stray in that other planet called Earth. She would also rarely visit the near by Boreios Sudesha, to hunt for different and exotic food. As she grew, her hunting and tracking skills expanded, and that is where she is today.
