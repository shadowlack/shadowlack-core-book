A nimble creature, despite her many years, Laluka can easily keep up with pendragons a third her age. She is tough and resilient, with wiry muscles and sinew. She is believed to be half-Yki; her wolfish build is unusual for any from the tribe. Her build is lupine, but she still retains the natural size and coat of her people. Although she is large for a Yki, she is still no bigger than a Labrador. Laluka prefers to remain in her quadruped form, but if necessary she can shift to bipedal. Although a huntress, and a warrior to be reckoned with, Laluka still retains an aristocratic air of femininity about her. In her quadrupedal form, she lacks hair, appearing much like a miss-sized, oddly colored wolf.

In her bipedal form, along with gaining many anthropomorphic traits, she may also been seen with soft, shoulder length hair. The soft lavender locks are often left loose, with a few small braids randomly placed about her head. There are often small ornaments, feathers, or beads woven into these braids. Her ears are slightly larger when she is in her bipedal form; long and more pointed than usual.

Her arctic white pelt is long and shaggy, giving her a wild appearance. Markings of pale purple mark her frosty coat; on her face they manifest on her cheeks and on the tips of her ears. A stripe of this same color runs along her spine and tail, and from it come four thick stripes, following her ribcage. Her tail is ringed, much like some species of earthen lemur, with the rings getting larger as they near the end of her tail. There is also a narrow ring around each leg, just under the knees and elbows, and another set just above her feet and on her wrists.

Laluka’s tribal tattoos, nearly covering her entire face, mark her as a high-ranking member of the Yki. The entire top of her head, and along the top of her muzzle has been tattooed solid black, with small area left out, to form four tiny triangles along the top of her muzzle. These triangles are slightly indented on the bottom, and they point towards the top of her head, directing an observers gaze towards her brow. Hidden under a tattooed eyelid is a third eye set deep into her brow. While her own eyes are a pale gray-green, her Third Eye is a fiery red-orange. It moves independently, seemingly with a will of it’s own.

Around her neck, suspended by a plain leather cord, is small amber stone. It’s meaning in unclear to most, but it is believed to hold great meaning to Laluka. On her left wrist is a thick wristband made of pinkish red coral, carved and decorated with black enamel. Bandages are wrapped about her left leg, and from them hang thin strings decorated with everything from teeth to feathers to beads. A thick tail-ring, like her wristband, only larger and heavier, is worn on her tail. She wears earrings frequently, but the number changes often.

Personality
-----------

A calm and centered soul, Laluka has mellowed out with the years. In her youth, she was a passionate warrior and a veritable ball of energy; quick to anger and even swifter when dealing out revenge. Now she is a quiet, soft-spoken healer with a more peaceful temperament and a cool head on her shoulders. There are times when she, or those dear to her are threatened, that her warrior spirit reawakens from its slumbers; during which she can be a hellcat, full of boiling rage and nearly impossible to calm down until her anger has run it’s course.

She is a wise ‘dragon, and has seen both sides of the coin. A natural diplomat and a peacemaker, Laluka is often called upon to settle disputes between others. Her logical mind and ability to see both sides of an argument give her excellent problem solving.

Lately she has become rather morose, since the disappearances of her tribe and children, and has become more and more agitated with each passing day.
