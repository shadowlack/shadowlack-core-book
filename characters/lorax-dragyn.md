If it had not of been for time and its impact, Lorax would be an identical carbon copy of his twin brother: Draco Dragyn. However, over time, their similar yet incredibly different lifestyles, has shaped two individuals who are not only different physically, but mentally as well.

Lorax's red fur-scales for example, are just a shade lighter than Draco's dark and fiery crimson. The fur itself is rather short and soft, but does grow slightly longer around Lorax's ankles and paws.

The hair atop Lorax's head is light blue in colour and has over time become intertwined with wisps of silver. Blades of blue-silver hair often fall over and around his face as well as taper down along the length of his spine in soft spikes. He also sports a scruffy lion-like mane around his neck that is also in this colour, as well as a small goatee on his chin.

Gifted with the means of flight, Lorax has two large purple-feathered wings. Underneath bright lighting, a soft undertone of sea green can be seen mingling around with the purple.

His tail-flame is average, as it burns the natural colour of fire. What is mildly strange about his tail is that his has two perpendicular knife-like growths jutting out just before the flame begins.

Lorax's markings are surprisingly simple. He has a thick black marking over his snout as well as black triangles burnt underneath both of his eyes. On his left haunch, Lorax also wears a tattoo given to him by his own mother Sari, a renowned seer. The tattoo is set up like a round target with feathered arrows set up at its compass points. The tattoo itself means something along the lines of 'Guide,' or 'Found'. Lorax, despite all the major pitfalls that he has faced in his life, has somehow managed to attain all four of his Grading stripes.

Personality
-----------

Lorax is much quieter than his twin brother, keeping many things to himself. He can slip into the carefree and fun filled pendragon he used to be on given occasions though. When he's not in a 'funk,' he likes to laugh, joke, and play harmless pranks on those around him. Despite having to be a father figure to so many youngsters, Lorax refuses to fully grow up. He likes to treat his own children (21 in total' yes, that is a lot) as if they were his best friends. When they do act out of line, he's forced to fall back into the stereotypical role of a father (as much as he dislikes it). When they're sick, or missing' he worries, which is to be expected, as he is a rather compassionate type.

Another word to describe Lorax would be proud. He's proud of who he is. He's proud of his accomplishments (although much shame is attached to some of them), his offspring, and most of all, he's proud of his heritage as a Dragyn. Not many onlookers notice this pride, but he does carry it with him in his gait, his words, as well as his actions.

His wife and life-mate, Ratha, is the one who continuously dampens his moods. She teeters from time to time on the brink of insanity, which makes Lorax more often than not, fear for her well-being.

History
-------

Beginnings

Lorax was born to Sari and Thanos Dragyn, the reigning Arch Magos and Magosai. His hatching was of particular importance, as he had an identical twin: Draco. Two living bodies inside one egg. As a result, when they finally did hatch, the two young boys were extremely tiny. However the very best care was provided and they grew much in the way that bad weeds do - quickly.

Terez, Sari and Thanos' first son, was less than happy about the birth of the twins. They 'stole the spotlight' that had once been on him. There was always a little bit of tension between Terez and the twins, who later became known as the Terrible Twosome due to their antics and pranks during school.

Accident?

One night in 81343 at the Dragyn residence on Ajita, there was a terrible explosion. The Arch Magos and Magosai were celebrating their 50th anniversary of planetary leadership. Although the following investigation never produced any conclusive results, it was generally understood that the explosion was cause by a malfunctioning Fronima conductor. Both Sari and Thanos perished in the explosion. The Dragyn reign came to an abrupt end.

After his parents seemingly "innocent" deaths, things for the Dragyn family never were the same. Shame got plastered to their name from failed space explorations and other incidents only helped the Dragyn's get "in over their heads". They were always to blame... but Lorax had the fleeting suspicion that perhaps they really were not at fault for all of the failures.

Candrice IV

After school, Lorax and Draco founded their own space exploration team. At first it was small, but as funding grew, it expanded into a massive project. They were able to secure their very own ship, Sha Pjudym Xemd III. Truth be told, it was a bit of a junker, but with the modifications that they and the rest of the crew made on it, it could give any other ship of the same class a run for its money.

After jumping through all sorts of hoops and legalities, their first official mission was underway. With a large crew made up predominantly of scientists, USR members, and civilians, they took off into space. Their destination was the planet Candrice IV. Their mission? To see if Candrice would be appropriate for colonization. The verdict? Definitely not.

Sha Pjudym Xemd III arrived on Candrice IV with no problems. For weeks the various teams worked, collecting crucial data about the planet - from simple things like water, to classifying the differing types of flora and fauna.

Unfortunately, on one cool morning, they ran into some fauna that they hadn't been expecting. The rapine. Immediately the alarm was sounded, distress signals sent, and the order was given to quickly evacuate the planet. However, Sha Pjudym Xemd III had decided to become unresponsive. After some quick system checks, it was found out that the ship had been sabotaged. It was dead. As a result, the secondary vessels had to be deployed... and it was soon found out that even a few of those had been tampered with.

In the resulting chaos, there were many deaths. Robyn Dragyn, Draco's wife, was among those slain. Several of Lorax's offspring were also killed (Marah, Beriah, Ygraine, Cauis, & Vinon) . Cabul & Ambrose's bodies were never found. Presumed to have been obliterated. It was a heavy blow to the Dragyn family. Fortunately what remained of the family was able to survive. A passing freighter managed to round up the rest of the survivors and bring them home.

With their mission a failure, the remaining Dragyns returned to Ramath-lehi. Ratharee, Lorax's mother, fell into a deep depression that just could not be lifted. Despite being shaken up badly and injured, the Dragyns managed to blend back into the Ramathian society. Shortly after their return to Ramath-lehi, Gardner, Lorax's eldest, deserted the family. Apparently wanting to get away from the curse that had befallen them and perhaps driven a little mad by what he had seen.

Presently

Lorax is a lot quieter than he used to be. His jokes and smiles don't come nearly as easily either. On most days he can be found looking after his wife. Her condition never did quite improve and it's effect can be easily seen upon Lorax. He seems weary. Tired. Sullen.

He wishes to be among the stars again. As that's where he feels he truly belongs. However, Ratharee won't allow it.
