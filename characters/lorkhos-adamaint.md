History
-------

One of the earliest of the [Adamaint](/genealogy/adamaint) line to become part of the Council of Twelve. His time on the council was short-lived, however, as within a decade of coming to power he suddenly passed away. Officially the cause of his death was serious illness, but many suspect that he was actually murdered... by an assassin that he had hired to help him in a plot to *fake* his death.
