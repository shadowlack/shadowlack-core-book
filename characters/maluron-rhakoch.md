All about .

A member of the [Bounty Hunter Brotherhood](/Bounty_Hunter_Brotherhood "wikilink"), and a Khell/Lukuo hybrid. Also a vampire. While he does take on a variety of jobs, he specialises in hunting rogue vampires and mages. To this end, he wears full-body armour and wields energy-based firearms and a sword. Notably he avoids Fromina-powered devices - a choice that seemed unconventional until the Flux hit, and he suddenly gained an advantage over other bounty hunters that relied solely on their magic or machinae.
