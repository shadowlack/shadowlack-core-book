## Physical description

Manji has light, almost neon green hair, that goes in spikey spurts down her back. She is constantly dyeing it random colors. She is about 5'8" if she were to stand upright. She weighs 147 pounds, about the size of an avarage humaniod.

## Personality

Manji tends to be quiet and reserved, tending to lurk in the shadows unless trouble arises. Those that know her well, know that although she is calm, when pushed too far, she has an unterminating temper that will last until what needs to be killed is killed.

## History

Manji doesn't know anything of her parents, besides their names. Her father died before she was born and her mother died from bleeding to death when she gave birth to her. She grew up secretly living in the sewers, hoping that no one at school would realize her true life. That is why she tends to hide, she fears that if they get to emotionally close to her, they will find out what she really is and hate her. Her journey now, besides teaching others her skills, is to find out who she really is, and where she really belongs.
