## Physical description

Misty is a light figured pendragon with blue/purple hair, tail and wings. Her fur is blue. Misty's wings are short and leathery. They aren't any good for flying, but great for helping Misty through the water. Her tail is kinda like a third wing on her back side. When she moves it back and forth, she can obtain great speeds in the water. Her paws are large and her toes are webbed. Her symbol is a bubble with H2O inside it, and over her left eye she has a black tattoo that looks like a round sawblade.

## Personality

Misty is a major 'treehugger'. She loves all living things, and dislikes the great wars with the Rapine. She is a vegitarian pendragon, eating only berries, kelp, fruits and vegetables.

## History

Misty has pretty much been brough up around the water. Her brother Aquatic *lives* in the water, but Misty cannot hold her breath for very long periods of time, so she fares better on land than him. Misty has always had somewhat of an accent, even though her parents never had one.
