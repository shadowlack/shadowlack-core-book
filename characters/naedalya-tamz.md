## Physical description

Nae's an ivory pelted Pendragon with long legs and a lanky appearance. Her hair is a light burgandy hue with streaks of black/darker burgundy in various places. This hair sprouts mostly atop her head, but also runs down the back of her neck until to the middle of her shoulder blades. She has thick, leathery dragon wings coloured dark grey, with four sections each. Her wings are very muscular, which help her a lot when doing Aerobatics. Some reptilian scales can be seen on her left side, mostly over the rib, and on her right haunch. Her tattoo is black, on her left haunch, it's a small star and a few geometric figures.

## Personality

Naedalya has a friendly disposition, her own original style and a unique personality. Despite her past, Nae has dusted herself off and has begun a new life, living solitarily. But if someone pushes her around and she doesn't like it, she can and will fight back. She's usually found lying in grass with her wooden board, some paper, and a few drawing pencils where she can spend all day drawing landscapes or friends of hers.

## History

Being the offspring of two talented Pendragons, both her parents busy Aerobats, Nae watched her parents fly through the sky at a very young age. She started practicing it herself, but one day her parents were performing live and they both crashed into the ground trying to perform a quadruple loop. Severely injured, they both remained in the care of other Pendragons. She forgets their name, which no one told her, but will always remember the crash that seperated them forever.
