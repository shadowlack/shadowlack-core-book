{{Character |name=Naka Dragyn |status=Alive |race=Pendragon |gender=Female |mother=[Robyn Savarally](/Robyn_Savarally "wikilink") |father=[Draco Dragyn](/Draco_Dragyn "wikilink") |significant_other=[Jargon Kavner](/Jargon_Kavner "wikilink") |player=Wolf Paws } Naka is a relatively normal sized pendragon for her age and sex. She used to be a very slender pendragon as a pup, but has thickened out nicely. Her hair is alot like her fathers, sectioned into lifeless spikes that are soft and slumped down over her face. She has let her hair grow out longer and it now hangs down over her shoulders. Her hair and tail colour was once a deep purple, but presently only a few streaks of purple can be found in her mothers red hair colour.

Although the end of her tail still shows her deep purple. Naka's face, wings and paws are all a nice mix of purple and blue. The hairs themselves are either of the colour, but the two colours together resemble Naka's grandmothers paws. And the rest of her fur (grey) was passed on from her grandmother, Sari, as well. Although Naka's grey coat is a very light shade of grey, much closer to white than Saris was. Naka doesn't have any tattoos or face markings at all. She has her symbol on her left haunch though. It is a coloured symbol of two hearts chained together and it means *loyalty*.

Personality
-----------

Naka has a very soft personality herself. But she does have a few unpleasant personality traits that she obviously got from her parents. Robyn's quick-to-anger attitude and Draco's weird and unpredictable personality have molded Naka into complicated pendragon who almost seems to be some freak mixture of her two parents and her grandmother. When Naka was a pup she used to believe that she was merely a clone, and had no personality of her own. But as she grew older she realized that neither of her parents possessed anything like her academic skills or her maturity. She didn't posses her fathers outgoingness or her mothers snippy almost reserved personality.

History
-------

Naka met [Jargon](/Jargon_Kavner "wikilink") in school and couldn't help but fall in love with his stammering problem. What started off as boyfriend and girlfriend quickly turned into love. Them getting together was the best thing that ever happened to Naka. When her mother died, Naka took it very hard. And a few years later, Terez got a hold of Draco and Lorax and when Naka seen her dad laying at the feet of Ratha and Zoar, she kind of exploded and took a swipe at her little cousin. But when her dad came too, she split, and being as disgraced as she was with herself, avoided him and the rest of her family for years. Her only friends during this time was Lorax's eldest son, her best friend Tanya, and Jargon. Even now she still tried to avoid Draco, but she doesn't realize how much it actually hurts him. He feels like he lost his wife and his only daughter. But they are a little closer these days. They are on somewhat of talking terms. But Naka still refuses to face Ratha, even though Zoar is the kind of guy to forgive and forget.
