Nickel's pack identification tattoo, the Ramathian symbol for "J65," is on his right palm.

Personality
-----------

Before he went missing, Nickel was fiercely focused. He desired to become the pride of his grandmother, whom had always praised him for his fine hunting skills, and perhaps even attain the lead hunting position in the JPack. But for all of his skill, which was brought out best when he was partnered with his twin sister, Cadmium, he never boasted, never bragged. He was a supreme athlete even at a young age, but he never lorded it over anyone. He tried to become the pride of the pack, but not the center of its attention.

Nickel was also known quite well for his "cute" comedy. Not only was he a promising youth, he also had an innocent sensor of humor that could knock any pack member into peals of laughter...

When his grandmother died, he was devastated, and nearly lost his strength and sense of humor. Soon after, however, he regained his strength, and with Cadmium's help, began to furiously dedicate himself to becoming a great hunter and a wonderful pack mate. Unfortunately, his wishes and dreams were washed away with him in the storm that ravaged the JPack.

History
-------

Nickel was born into a group known as the JPack, an extended family of sixty-four aquabats that lived in the cove-like area of the Sagar Sea, south of Boreios Sudesha and north of Notios Sudesha. This particular pack was quite contemporary in civilization and behavior, so he was born to a committed, monogamous pair. His parents also produced another offspring alongside him, a twin sister named Cadmium. The two were born during the natural breeding season for most animals — Dyo. They were numbers sixty-five and sixty-six in their family, and were always well cared for, happily nourished, and carefully nurtured. The members in the JPack were aunts, uncles, and cousins, and all treated the new twins with special, tender care, but also with a fierce sense of guardianship. The most intense caretaker of the youngest JPack members was the Alpha female, the matriarch of the pack. She was their grandmother, their mother's mother — their mother had been her third daughter — and she loved the little ones very dearly. As she had done with the many young ones before Nickel and Cadmium, she took it upon herself to teach them, train them, and instill in them pride in themselves, their identities, and their pack.

Close despite their opposite genders, Nickel and Cadmium enjoyed a fairly normal childhood. Upon reaching pre-adolescence, their bond only grew tighter. The twins made an excellent hunting team, and they had learned very well from their grandmother. Oftentimes, instead of playing around with their same-age cousins, they practiced and sharpened their hunting skills, become especially adept at using echolocation, as well as stunning fish with the lash of a finned tail. Their grandmother thought more highly of them than any other young ones in the JPack, and encouraged them to always hone their skills. Luckily, no jealousy was bred from this favor; indeed, all of the JPack pack mates realized how special Nickel and Cadmium were, and helped them in every way they could.

On the cusp of becoming true teenagers, tragedy struck the twins' pack. Their grandmother, the Alpha female, their beloved leader, became very ill, and died. For a while, the JPack was without a matriarch to guide them. There was a small fuss about it, as many of the members argued over whom should succeed the throne. Some family members even nominated Cadmium, but seeing as she was much too young and inexperienced, it was eventually her mother whom took the honored position.

After a while of grieving, the JPack moved on past the death of their former leader, and learned to embrace the twins' mother as the new Alpha. She was a wonderful leader, having learned much from her mother, and the pack thrived. However, all was not to stay simple and sweet.

Nickel and Cadmium's mother had three new eggs in her pouch, and everything seemed to be going grandly. The family was expanding, the twins were still excelling at hunting techniques, and the memory of the matriarch lived on in the spirit of the JPack. However, all the glory and happiness ended in an abrupt sea storm. The JPack's shallow territory was ravaged, their simple underwater city torn apart to lay in wreckage. Many were killed, including the twins' mother, as well as the unborn triplets in her pouch. Several more were injured, or missing.

One of those was Nickel. He hasn't been seen since.
