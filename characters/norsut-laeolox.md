All about .

A former member of the [Bounty Hunter Brotherhood](/Bounty_Hunter_Brotherhood "wikilink"). Nicknamed "Cyclops" for his distinctive face - namely, having a single eye in the middle of his face, as well as large tusks emerging from his mouth. While his eyesight wasn't as bad as one would be led to think - his field of vision was *extremely* wide - it probably says something that he was primarily taught to rely more on his other senses in combat.

Norsut was *very* good at his job, and specialised in hunting mages who had gone rogue. (It helped that he was a well-trained mage himself.) However, many 'dragons found it difficult to get along with him, largely owing to his abrasive, outspoken and stubborn nature. Ironically, one of the people he grew closest to was abrasive, outspoken and stubborn herself - one would think that this would lead to a clash of personalities, but Norsut and his last apprentice, [Marei](/Marei "wikilink") Kynigos, got along quite well...

...well enough that he was willing to sacrifice his own life to make sure that she escaped from a powerful and deranged Rapitelli mage.
