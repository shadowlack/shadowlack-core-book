Legendary hero and Warlord of Swaraj. Nuji Kaztohaat was the son of Saios, who had been dethroned by his treacherous brother in a coup; Nuji grew up among Feydragons, and when he came of age he was gifted with the magical hammer *Shompaj*. He and three friends took the throne back and ruled for nearly a century until he was killed in battle with a demon army. Whether Kaztohaat actually existed, or his story actually happened is up for debate, as the details surrounding the exact time and circumstances tend to contradict each other.
