All about .

Appearance
----------

Slight of frame and diminutive of height at just under three feet tall, Nyulie falls right into line with other Feydragons. Her coat is creamy white, broken up with slim stripes of airy blues, purples and pinks along her neck and sides, all extending from the dip of her spine. All four limbs are willowy and slim to affect delicate airs; this is echoed in dainty, fox-like features that make up the creation of her face. Her eyes are a pale, crystalline silver, matching the flame that alights at the tip of her tail. She boasts dragonfly wings of delicate, filmy silver, looking entirely ineffectual for flying. The runic tattoos that break up the fur on her body glow with a white light and have the chill of an early morning breeze, their designs whimsical around biceps and collarbone.

The clothing she chooses to wear are often suited to fleeing, rather than attempts to be gaudy; loose pants that wrap tight against her knees and waist with bands of cloth tend to be a favorite, often paired with a well-fitting top of any style. She rarely wears gloves or headgear, but has a fondness for jewelry, which often makes her sneaking around more difficult than it needs to be (after all, a love of jingly, jangly gold and silver likely doesn't make good on stealth).

Personality
-----------

Nyu is fickle and flighty, though she lacks the drive to do anything truly difficult. Instead, she'd rather flirt her way through life and make alliances that benefit her and leave her without the need to perform hard labor. She cheats her way around social circles, cheats her way into money, and cheats her way around the world -- the only thing she doesn't cheat with is her work in aerokinesis.

Relationships
-------------

### Family

**Hoa Tien** was Nyulie's sole caregiver, and though Nyulie was very fond of her mother, the two women were never close. Hoa died during Nyulie's adolescence of disease, prompting Nyu to become a proper citizen of Ramath-lehi within Bhim.

Her father, **Rhameros Ulill**, was never really in Nyulie's life; he disappeared shortly after her hatchday and she assumes he's deceased.

History
-------

One of Bhim's Ehemoya Children of Renn-nukhs, Nyu is the byproduct of two Alanamsul Feydragons in the shady city. She was raised by her mother without her father, who disappeared shortly after her hatchday -- she assumes he's dead. As soon as she was able, she spent most of her time trying to help her mother work; without the drive to get projects done, however, she mostly tricked and swindled others into helping instead. This love of manipulating people didn't fade as she aged, and she became quite good at doing very little while making it seem like she was doing a lot. Her mother died to disease in Bhim during Nyulie's adolescence, an event that factored into her choosing to take on Ramathian citizenship, something she previously wasn't capable of having.

She spends much of her time improving her control of air, believing it to be important to how Renn-nukhs favors her. Since the death of her parents, the Numegola is the only progenitor she opts to acknowledge.
