Plicae is a solid black color, though the topside of his short lapin tail is orange, and the underside is a stark white. He has matching orange and white highlights in his hair, as well. Otherwise, he bears no markings or tattoos, save for the orange and white bands tattooed on his genitals.

He has a lean, tall build – he’s 6’4” and roughly 175 lbs. – and he has always been lanky. He has particularly long arms and legs, though he comes across as graceful more so than gangly. His facial features are somewhat draconic; he has a blunt muzzle and short, rounded ears. Two fairly unremarkable antennae sprout from his hair, which is short in some places and long in others, and often falls haphazardly over his face. He wears glasses because he has weak vision. But his most notable physical feature of all is his wings – or what’s left of them. Protruding from his shoulders are two stumps, healed over by now, markers of the time when his glorious wings were singed off in a fire.

Personality
-----------

The first thing to note about Plicae is his gentlemanly nature. He’s almost sickeningly sweet and polite, and very mild in his mannerisms. He almost never gets angry, and he’s quite the diplomat when it comes to formal situations. He’s actually kind to a fault, and will often put himself on the line in order to be polite and thoughtful towards others.

On a deeper level, Plicae is quite a sensitive and sad individual. His wife’s death killed a part of his heart forever. He’s not outwardly emotional, though he does often cry, and is not ashamed of doing so. He’s very lonely and brooding, but tries his best to remain civil, quiet, and gracious in the company of others, saving his tears for his pillow at night.

History
-------

When he was a nioti, Plicae showed a keen interest in things like political science and criminal justice, and thus his studies at Cajseu University in Ajita focused upon many governmental courses. He excelled in his classes, and graduated by the time he was 18.

His first job after graduation was to do general “pro bono” research for various pro-Grader organizations. His superiors said it would be a good experience. Though he made no money, Plicae enjoyed his various assignments. His favorite one involved a thill named Jejunem; she was a fellow law graduate, and the two worked together on a few cases. They were so alike, they immediately had chemistry, and it wasn’t long before they became romantic.

They dated for many years, and when Plicae was 36 and Jejunem 33, the two married. Not long after, the two had a child together: Villi. They decided not to have any more offspring, and focused their attention upon their daughter. The family of three made a tightly bound unit, and they were quite close. Both Plicae and Jejunem also worked at paid jobs at this point, and they brought in enough funding to send Villi to Uslumset College in Aurius. In short, the family was happy, healthy, and wealthy.

But all three of these things came to a sudden end one day. For unknown reasons, a pro-Grader organization suspected Jejunum of high treason. Taking matters into their own hands, they went to the Decaturs’s Ajita home, and, simply put, burnt it to the ground. Only Jejunum herself was home – Plicae was on task, and Villi was far away, at school – and the perpetrators stayed to ensure that the kiom could not escape. They only fled when Plicae, having sensed something was the matter, came home. He was too late to save his wife, though. He tried, and ended up singing his wings off entirely, but he just couldn’t save her.
