He was said to be the greatest [Menlo](/entertainment/menlo "wikilink") player in the world. His skills and technique were unmatched and unbeatable. He was the only player ever to win the Annual Spring Tournament 3 consecutive years. Raebin was the player that inspired young pendragons and made the game increasingly popular. He created many of the most valuable codes that are still used today. Raebin died unexpectedly at the age of 47 during what would be his fourth Annual Spring Tournament during a match. It was a major historical event in the history of the game. There is no evidence that his death was caused by the game, but doctors were unable to come up with any cause of death.

Some huge fans of the player believe that Raebin's opponent in the match, W. Kalkoru, had implanted an undetectable virus in his card that would somehow keep Raebin from escaping the game and would be virtually killed by Kalkoru's suit. There is no evidence to support this theory as this never happened to any of Kalkoru's other opponents and no other deaths or even injuries where ever recorded before or after this event.
