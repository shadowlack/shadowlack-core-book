## Physical description

Tall, sleek, beautiful yet mysterious, Rain would and could pass as a spy, con artist, or murderess. But in all reality she certainly has nothing do with such trades, in fact she is a master at poisons and the trade of healing. Standing 6 feet 8 inches at the shoulders, she is about a head taller than most femme pendragons. She is slender, not very muscular, and somewhat fragile looking but her long limbs give her much agility. Her wings are unlike most and many often call her the "fairy pendragon", instead of dragon typed leather wings and feathered avian wings, Rain posses butterfly like wings. Her wings are swirled with hues of lavender, cerulean, and silver matching her ivorn frame and purpure optics nicely. As for her tail, it too is long about 5 feet 7 inches in length, many could say it gives her balance when running at high speeds. When it comes to markings, Rain has three lavender tattoo bands on each limb, just above her paws and five rings tattooed 'round the end of her tail, the tip of her ears are also lavender in hue.

## Personality

Sweet, kind, loving, polite, and overall a friendly, social yet mysterious pendragon, Rain is a pretty nice character to make friends with. Very humble she spends most of her time, helping out the young, sick, and injured pendragons she finds. Using her experience in healing and poisons (and just the opposite of poison - anti poison), she puts all her heart into her work. Many of her patients call her a "Guardian Angel", sent to them by the spirit world of Fronmia.

## History

Rain, sadly never knew her real mother or father. She was adopted by an elder pendragon named Yakoni Aseria, and it was him who gave her the name Rain Ali' Sacerii. She never knew he was her adopted father till she turned 2 000, that's when the secret came out. It destroyed her inside, and as much as Yakoni tried, nothing could pull her from the pit of depression she had fallen into. Over time however, she has learned to except fate and to this day still calls Yakoni "Daddy". She went to Janardan Academy and graduated as a journeyman in poisons and healing, after receiving her journymanship in both trades she sought to be a master. That is when her travels sent her to Odisti Aatalis, a renowned master of poisons. It toke a few years, but Rain eventually became a master at the art of poisoning, equaling if not exceeding the knowledge of Odisti. It was than that she returned to Yakoni and he taught her all she could learn about the trade of healing. Now at the age of 3 200, Rain is an adult and lives on the island of Mansukh. Though she may travel now and than, she always returns to her tender little cottage on the beach of Oankii. Her adopted father Yakoni has moved in with her and stays all year 'round in Rain's household.
