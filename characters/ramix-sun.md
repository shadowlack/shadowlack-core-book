## Physical description

He looks basicly the exact same as [Selenity](/characters/selenity-sun) except his hair hanging in front of his face is black and his tail has a flame around its blade.

## Personality

He is the exact opposite of Selenity and loves helping people. He is very intelligent and brave. He knows how to counter all of his sister's magic and attacks because he was her partnering student when she learned it all.

## History

Ramix comes from the [Sun](/genealogy/sun) family and is on good terms with his parents unlike Selenity. He also was a training partner for Selenity when she learned all she knew. But he decided that those trades were based on destruction so he went the path that could be more helpful than hindering. He is also the only person Selenity fears and will listen to without argument and he knows it.
