## Physical description

Having been genetically altered, bieng about 5" 10'  he looks somewhat different from a pendragon, yet he is clearly pendragon. His eyes are adapted to darkness and are hawklike in thier focusing ability, so they appear slightly larger than normal and the iris is almost black, making his eyes appear bigger still. His head is shaped somewhat like a greyhound's, with a long snout which is filled with sharp teeth. He has claws that are curved much like a velociraptor's claws, hence his name. The fur 'scales' are smaller and are thicker and slightly jagged, so he can use them in a certain way as a slashing tool. His tail however has normal hairs, but has several bony knobs along it's length which act like a club. He does have the ability to change colors at will, but is normally almost entirely obsidian black with blue scale/hair edges and ends. The flame is also strange in that it is black as well, but has thousands of tiny streamers of blue and red swirling in it. Other features he has are a long mane of deep green hair and he has green stripes on his legs.

## Personality

He sometimes acts somewhat crazy, but this is rare now as he matures, but he has some insanity within himself. He is what one might call an insane warrior, he has a code of honor, but he has a deeply evil side that can unleash itself with terryfying ferocity.

## History

What little is known about his origns is that he was created in an obscure lab by some rich clan in  the Watani region of Swaraj. After that, he was sent to an adopted family and was trained to become a warrior, origionally, they intended for him to carry out thier plans, but he rebelled and struck out on his own, becoming a mercenary and a killer with his own, dark, agenda.
