Requiem Falahau is [Arsenic Strychnine](/characters/arsenic-strychnine "wikilink")'s only child. Born into the northern wasteland of the Hrishikesh sea ice and the Sompjufylv tribe, he eventually left Dhruv and his tortured childhood with a scholarship to Dragonbach's and formed Ramath-lehi's most beloved band - [Parallax](/entertainment/parallax "wikilink"). He is well-known for being the object of million's affections and the lover of Cayson Lapices.
