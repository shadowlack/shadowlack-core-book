## Physical description

Rhei's crippled right hind leg is often the first thing she's recognised by.  Her vibrant green eyes are not commonly missed either.  Her tattoo resembles, at first glance, a twisted wooden rod, standing vertically.  But if seen closer, a single eye appears to be shaped into the top of the rod.  The tattoo rests  on her left haunch, while the rest of her body is  splotched with various shades of brown and green.  Her hair is rather unruly.  It has a naturalness to it, despite how unkempt it may seem, and is an inky shade of black with a brown tint to it under sunlight.

## Personality

Rhei is very timid, but has a warm nature.  She listens well and usually feels less significant because of her disability.  She often will let others walk all over her and take advantage of her, but to a limit.  Rhei is ambitious, however, and determined to, someday, be of use.  She currently is trying to master the art of shape-shifting, but has not succeeded so far.  She generally avoids fights, but if pushed over the edge, she prefers to plot revenge and carry it out on the offender later.

## History

Rhei has had her twisted leg for as long as she can remember.  She never quite got the facts on how it happened, but doesn't think much of it.  Her mother took care of her, and her father wasn't around much.  She had a single brother, but he was much older than she was, and he has long since left his homeland.  Her childhood was basically pretty normal, minus the leg.
