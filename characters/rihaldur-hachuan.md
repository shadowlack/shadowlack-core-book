[Binail](/Binail "wikilink")'s dad. He's a scribe/secretary for the Rauamaak clan's Court... which, unfortunately, is //very stressful//. He and his son claim it's because more than half of the Court aren't competent enough to be in their positions, and that's putting it politely.

Rihaldur has a beard. He also has big ears, though they're nowhere near as big as his son's.
