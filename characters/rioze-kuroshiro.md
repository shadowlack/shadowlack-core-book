## Physical description

Rioze has a coat composed mostly of gray. At the end it is tipped with a light silver color. The only scales he has is on the edge of his back, the potruding ones being black. His eyes change from gray to gold. The only time that happens is..when he feels pure happiness. The hair leading to the face turns ever darker. His coat is perfect for his job.

## Personality

Very cold. The last time he truly smiled....no one knows. A great mystery, even his employers are frightened by him. He'll take any job, as long as there's enough money but...there was one time he refused but no one knows why or what happened after. Despite his young age the Graders have noticed him... for good or worse. Still with his skillfullness, he of all has doubts of his purpose. That may be the thing keeping him alive. He is also known not to be above assassination though it is not his trade....

## History

Rumored to be trained in secret in the mountains. Mother and Father are both dead. Father when he was in a fight and Mother trying to birth-where the Nioti is no one is sure. Alone he's experienced much, it's said he left to see if there was anything that was worth seeing and another says it's because his Master (teacher) died. After, he's been living as an Poison brewer using his Elemental Sorcery trade to help also. He deems so far nothing significant.
