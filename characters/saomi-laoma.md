## Physical Description

A thin framed but muscular Pendragon, Saomi was a bit smaller than most females. Long legs and a deep chest, she looked more like a canid Greyhound than a lupine. That pelt was a mixture of soft browns and burnt crimsons, a marbling effect swarmed over her frame. A ruffle of deep indigo lay atop her head before slithering down to nestle between her shoulder blades. Those eyes were of a lemon-lime hue, hinting to the heritage of feline and dracon ancestory. Short but sharp claws were onyx in hue.

## Personality

Saomi was a fire ball, full of energy. Since she was always picked on for her frail looking frame, she built up this wicked attitude and the need for sarcasm. A bit of a joker, she would always poke fun at whoever was around. Pranks were also a specialty with her. She had her wits about her and rarely was ever found trusting anyone.

## History

Abandoned by her family for being to tiny, she was adopted by a stray pendragon with no name. This female taught Saomi the ropes of living alone. She never was given markings, so the old female showed her how to create Tattoos and she created her own. Now she uses it as a profession, offering her services to those who wish to be marked.
