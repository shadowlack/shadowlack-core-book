The Guildmaster of the [Bounty Hunter Brotherhood](/groups/bounty-hunter-brotherhood), having held the position since his late 70s. Like [his brother](/characters/ruos-halnakh-devolithin), Schevsdan comes from a military background, but unlike Ruos, he left the Trilok army after 12 years and went on to join the Brotherhood. Over the decades he rose through the ranks to become one of their elites, and eventually was elected as Guildmaster to replace the old one, who was planning to retire.

As a member of the Volithin bloodline, Schevsdan's Khell heritage shows very strongly; the only sign that he has any Lukuo blood is the fact that he has multiple pairs of horns coming from his head. He often wears special temperature-controlling full-body suits to prevent him from overheating, as he has the Khell's protective layer of blubber and lives in a much warmer climate than Trilok. Though, he has stated repeatedly that he will not remove it - not when it's saved his life so many times in the past.
