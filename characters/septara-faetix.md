## Physical description

Septara takes on a more feline appearance than most Pendragons. Standing seven feet at the withers, his built is quite muscular yet lean enough to give him much agility. His fur/scales are a deep jade, somewhat matching his shabby ebon mane which runs along his neck and stops dead at his shoulders. His spine sickly is exposed and runs down to the base of his tail. One thing anyone would note first are Septara's eyes, they are strangely multi colored, swirled with hues of azure, purpure, ruby, emerald, and gold. His eyes give him an awkward appearance, but never the less one should NEVER gaze into them least they be doing his biddings. The fireball on the end of his tail is red in hue, deeply contrasting the rest of his physique. Also to take note, he has a few piercing and tattoos. On the part of tattoos, he has one ebon marking shaped into a ball of fire on each haunch and he also is branded with three stripes under his left eye. As for piercing, his nose is pierced with a silver loop ring and his left eye lid is pierced also with a matching ring.

## Personality

Nice? No, No, No, NO! Cold, rude, mean, ill-tempered, and overall unsociable, Septara isn't the kind you'd like to run into. Evil? Maybe... No one really knows for sure, and one really can't peer into his inner being, his thoughts are clouded, absurd, somewhat cruel matching his appearances respectively. Hypnotism? Ha?! Err, better not say that in front of him, he'd teach you a lesson mighty quick... And it may not be that pretty... And just try to hunt him down, he knows when your coming for him even if your across the planet. As he says, inner sight helps out all the time and pays off in every way...

## History

His mother and father were sent on a mission by the Graders, they never returned and that was the last he saw of them. He never really minded much, their "life expectancy" was up anyhow. He lived part of his life in within the Ajita mountains, isolated and cold, but he loved it there. Than from there he moved to Bhim, and than after living there a while he was banished to the Notios Sudesha Desert for some crimes he had commited. He settled down and became less violent when he hit 40 and once again isolated himself to Ajita. He's quite fond of the Graders and has got them to let him live a few extra years. Well his "life expectancy" is nearly here again and he's at his best trying to provide the Graders with favors and such for a "few" more years on Ramath-lehi.
