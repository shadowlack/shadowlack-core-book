**Personality:** Sephere is a kindhearted yki, helpful and conversative. Shi's good at listening and giving advises to people. Shi's far from any hunter or warrior, but more of a supporter, doing what shi can to help other Ykii whilst out on hunting missions with both injuries and recommendations. Shi's playful at times when hir inner child strikes through and when so, shi can be found rolling around in the snow, leaping after various insects or batting around with things. Shi's most of the time however, focused and quite thoughtful about what shi does. Shi often reflects about instances shi's been through or what might come in the future. If shi hears something, shi'll think it through deeply. Being almost naivety hirself and on top of being submissive of nature, it's a wonder shi hasn't been mated yet or even found a better half. Shi can easily be persuaded to follow a cause, live out an idea or do something under the right circumstances, which in the past, at times lead hir to get in trouble. Shi however, will start to think about things if shi gets suspicious about hir being used, and shi'll start to withdraw and fall back, maybe even try to flee.

**Physical traits:** Sephere is smaller than other Ykii, and slightly slimmer, thus having a thick furcoat and rather big wings coated in feathers. Shi got a feather/quill mane running from the top of hir head and down along hir back, approximately to the middle of the back. These quills are white, except for three feathers on top of hir head, directly above the amethyst in hir forehead, which are purple. Shi got some faint markings under the fur and over the face which can be seen clearly when light falls on hir from the right direction. The gem in hir forehead is teardrop shaped and shi usually keeps it covered with some of the fur and hair of hirs. Along hir tail, occasional bracelets and cuffs can be seen, but mostly around hir tailtip where one can find a scythelike blade which, indeed, is as sharp as it looks. Also to mention, the tailtip most of the time is covered by a specific bracelet with quills and another amethyst. Usually, if one gets to spot it, shi can be seen with cuffs around hir ankles and wrists which at first glance would seem to not serve any specific purpose, but who knows...
