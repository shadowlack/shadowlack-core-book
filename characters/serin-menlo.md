**Serin Menlo** is the creator of the wildly popular game, [Menlo](/entertainment/menlo "wikilink"). He began his career as a successful robotics engineer after graduating from [Hyota Yv Daujt](/schools/hyota-yv-daujt "wikilink") at the top of his class.

One day he took his two children to his work and they insisted on playing with every robot. They even tried to fight each other with the massive metallic monsters. Serin did not want his children to get hurt so he created a type of game inside a virtual reality where the two could fight with robots without getting injured.

Originally it was all one large machine, there were no cards just two robots implanted in the generator that stayed the same every game. Eventually his children got bored, so Serin decidedto make it so they could battle with a different robot every time.

Thus the Menlo game was born. Serin is still the head of the [Menlo Competitions Corporation](/menlo-competitions-corporation "wikilink"), and has become quite wealthy and famous. Although he has never played the game himself, he is the leading expert on most aspects of the game and has published a few Menlo guidebooks and instruction manuals.
