APPEARANCE: Silaka's father is a Yki from the Ekavyz tribe, while her mother is a Lukuo from Bhim. She has white fur with green highlights on her snout, feet, hands, and her back has a large path of green fur in the middle of it. One of her mutations is her four ears. She has two on each side, one above the other. Another of her mutations is her bone spikes that stick out of her elbows. These spikes extend only a centimeter away, and look more like nubs than spikes. She has green feathers starting at her wrist and ending at below her elbows, they tightly hug her arms, extending only an inch away. She has reddish brown eyes. Her hair is a mess of green and white going down to about the middle of her back in a wavy style.

HISTORY: Silaka was born while her mother, an anthropologist, was off studying Yki tribes and had a relationship with one of the tribe's members. She was then left by her mother with the tribe. She was raised according to the Yki methods and when she reached the age of twenty, she was encouraged to leave the tribe and find people more similar to her. On her first day in Bhim, she was being mugged, but then a Lukuo shopkeeper froze the two crooks solid. From him she learned cryokinesis. After living in Bhim for two years she went to Swaraj and earned a degree in performance arts, specifically dancing. She then moved back to Bhim, got a job as a bartender, and occasionally works in the local theater as a dancer. She has been having financial troubles lately, and she has been raising all the money she can to move to somewhere where she can actually make a career as a dancer.
