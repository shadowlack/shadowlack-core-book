## Physical description

The majority of Silvente's body is a very light brown color, with black stripes ranging across it in an almost (in earth terms) tigerlike pattern. Her eyes are the same color as her coat, minus the stripes. On her left haunch, a simple circle with three triangles within it is visible. It's meaning being 'never-ending life'. Silvente is rather vague on what exactly it means, but that is the most basic translation.

## Personality

Silvente isn't too seclusive. While outgoing, she tends to hold back on friendship. It takes her a long time to trust others. She wears a mask when around others, to hide the real her. Most know a different face of Silvente then what lies beneath... who really knows her?

## History

Silvente is extremely vague about her past. Mostly because she has forgotten the majority of it. When she was young, she fell out of a tree while climbing after a bird, and promptly hit the ground. It gave her permanant amnesia, and she left her home because of it. A street-urchin, some might say. After that, she made her way by earning money, and learning her two trades at school. She wants to become a Master someday, in her trades, but it is a dream far from coming true.
