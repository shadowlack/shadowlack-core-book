## Physical description

Her pelt is the deepest color of red, that of blood spilled on a moonless night.  To stare at it for to long is to see the patterns of blue and black that swim beneath the complexity of the color, not to be unraveled easily.  Her mane is the purest snow white shade and it falls between her shoulder blades, spiked in an unruly manner.  Sinja's eyes are a pale blue shade like those of an albino, ever alert and watchful.

## Personality

Sinja's mind is a complex pattern that is in no way easily unraveled.  At once she is a quiet and reserved artist, content to spend hours or even days alone with her thoughts and stories, inventing and recording all that passes through her mind, not even bothering to take sustenance or bother with anyway.   Yet so disconnected as she seems from the outside world she revels in sensuality, recognizing that to write well she must experience and get to the core of all that goes on in the world around her.  Diplomatically adept and manipulative but kind to those that show her the same courtesy , and do not have some future part in the web she weaves.

## History

Her history is a clouded thing, she is not aware of who her parents were, raised by a kindly family that took her in but she had no real ties with them and so decided to venture out on her own.
