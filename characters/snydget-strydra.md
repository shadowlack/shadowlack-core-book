## Physical description

Snydget is a somewhat small pendragon in build. Though she stands about about 4 feet tall, she is underweight and bony. She is black with blood-red stripes, giving her a spooky appearence. Her red, bladed hair is long, but clasped back with a silver clip.

## Personality

Weird and mysterious, Snydget tries her best to be aloof and dark, but just can't seem to do it properly. Overly hyperactive and friendly, she was skilled at telepathy at a young age, giving her an advantage to using Inner Sight. Her telekenisis is only starting to develop, but she can't seem to use it without making something explode, melt or disinigrate yet. She's also quite easily distracted, dispite her intelligence.

## History

Snidget grew up in the mountains with her mother and father, an engineer and a lockpick, respectively.
