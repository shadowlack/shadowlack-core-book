## Physical description

Pure gold in color, with bronzed stripes running across his powerful limbs. He has dragonic eyes, of frozen emerald shades. He has blond-white hair, resembling a mane. His flame color is normally a pale, almost translucent white.

## Personality

Quiet and kind, a loner by nature. He sees things in life as having a balance, no matter what. He's gentle and warm, though has a bit of a cold aura about him.

## History

His parents were both killed in an "accident" when he was young, so he's always been very independent. He's spent most of his life just trying to stay alive, yet hasn't been turned cold.
