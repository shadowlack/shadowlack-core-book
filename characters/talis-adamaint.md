Known widely for his [machina](/machina "wikilink") inventions and teleportation innovations, Talis is a leading inventor on Ramath-lehi. While his interest in machina is vast, his true expertise lies within creating life-like magicka-powered [machina prosthetics](/machina-prosthetics "wikilink") for pendragons who would otherwise be disabled. The price for such custom tailored machina is exceedingly high, however Talis has been known to give potential clients deals, as well as trade services for other goods and sometimes even a simple favour or two. Talis is the sole heir to the entire [Adamaint Empire](/adamaint-empire "wikilink"), and can often be found lurking around the [Neurotech Research Facility](/neurotech-research-facility "wikilink").
