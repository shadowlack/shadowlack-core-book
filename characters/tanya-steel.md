## Physical description

Tanya is a little bit shorter than her best friend Naka, who is just a bit younger than her. She has long powder blue hair and tail, and light yellow wings. The rest of her fur is ghost white.

## Personality

Tanya has a wicked personality. She is the biggest fake you've ever seen. To her boyfriend's mother, she plays the roll of a sweet little angel, but around his Dad, she is...well a bitch.

## History

Tanya's boyfriend is Ratha and Lorax' eldest son, Gardner. Her best friend since she was just a pup has always been [Naka](/characters/naka-dragyn). She had planned on dropping school, but Naka talked her into staying. She took most of the classes Naka did. But while Naka was more into Inner Sight, Tanya had the knack for Hypnotism. They are the perfect pair. (even though Naka is a little more calm and cool, and Tanya is wild and free) Of course, Draco, Naka's Dad has never approved of their friendship, being that Naka could never face him, Tanya always had the nerve to tell him off when he needed it.
