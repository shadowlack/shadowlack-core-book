Terez's fur is a light maroon colour, and his mane and goatee are both dark violet-red. His hair colour is a dark slate blue, and it is short and spiky. He also has the same coloured hair in tufts at his elbows. Terez wears blueish green cuffs around his ankles that have alternating black stripes (one points up, one points down). His symbol on his left haunch is a "Z" with a rectangle above it, a triangle below and to the left of it, and two curves to the right of it. Its meaning, *"loud, anger"*.

Terez has a tattoo on his left shoulder as well of a small spiral. Around his eyes is a dark marking resembling a raccoon's mask. Under his left eye is a long scar, given to him by none other than his younger brother's wife, [Ratha](/characters/ratharee-dragyn "wikilink"). At one point in his life, Terez earned all four of his stripes, but since then has done something to piss off the Grader's enough to scratch out all four of those stripes. Terez has had no ambition to earn them back. And Lastly, Terez's tail flame is quite unique. It burns a black flame, with traces of blue in the middle.

## Personality

The only way to put Terez's personality would be angry. No matter what time of day or who he is with he always seems to be angry. The off moment he isn't angry, he is anal, arrogant, and most of all untrustworthy.

# History

Terez' younger brothers, Lorax and Draco may not want to admit it, but Terez sure knows that his parents death was no accident. Terez set his mind that day that it was the Graders fault, and has been planning, not so secretively, to overthrow the Grader's rule, and reinstate the Dragyn rule. He has made many attempts, but all have ended in failure. Lately, Terez has doubled his efforts to overthrow the Grader's reign, for he knows that his life expectancy is coming to an end. Terez has tried to ally with his younger brothers many times, occasionally forcefully, to assist him with his evil doings, but the twins fail to see what this means to Terez.

Terez' expertise in Interrogation and Law are used to his own advantage in recruiting more and more followers, but in the end, he always turns up short. So far he has only gotten youthful pendragons to assist him like his 15 year old son, [Mezzo](/characters/mezzo-dragyn "wikilink"), but the older they get, the stronger they become. It is rumoured that among Terez's followers is the elders Echo and Dobo, and the Avrum kids: [Assassin](/characters/assassin-avrum "wikilink") and [Lotkeh](/characters/lotkeh-avrum "wikilink"). However [Kati Avrum](/characters/kati-avrum "wikilink") has made it clear on several occasions that her sons are not followers, but that can't be said for Echo and Dobo. There isn't a pendragon on Ramath-lehi that doesn't know his name. When it comes to war, no one is sure what side he's on. Terez has certainly made an impact on the Pendragon system over his 64 years of existence.
