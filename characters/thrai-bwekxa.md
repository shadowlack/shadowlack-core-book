At 8, Thrai started playing the flute. His parents thought of sending to Dragonbach's Musical Academy. He didn't want to but soon accepted to go. He went there to learn how play a flute properly. With each passing year, he got better and better and it. As the time went on, he met Will there. They were immediately best friends, but there feelings for each other grew into something else.

At 20, Thrai met another ardan, who was also a Yki. He was hoping to marry this ardan, but stayed together for also a quarter, then Thrai was dumped again. His soul couldn't be patched up with new love. It couldn't patch up the part that was William. He tried to find ways to fix it. He then traveled the world, playing his flute along the way. He journeyed through the Machina Ruins and ventured through the Tmu Desert. He went all over the place.
