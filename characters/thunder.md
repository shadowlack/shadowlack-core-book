## Physical description

Thunder is a thickheaded male Pendragon. He has a deep chest and larger paws then most Pendragons, and his tail, quite oddly, is short and stubby. This odd build makes him look like an Earthly boxer. His fur is onyx in hue while the hair running from forehead to his shoulderblades is a vibrant electric blue. His paws are white, and three jagged edged stripes running along his back lengthwise. On his left hauch is a tatoo of the same style of stripe, but thinner, two crossed over each other in an X pattern with the last running downwards by the leftmost cuts. A rocky symbol in near the center, and where the stripes meet is a small dot. This marking is white, like his stripes and paws. He has large, black leathery wings, like those of a bats. These are fringed with the same electric blue of his mane. His eyes are a cold silver.

## Personality

Thunder is an outsider. He prefers his own company than that of others, so he keeps to himself on the islands of Rjita and Bhim.

## History

Thunder was born on the isle of Rjita. His parents abandoned him at the age of three for being unruly and dangerous. Thunder, unaffected by this, followed his tribe to a river. In the dead of night he decided that if he would not stay, neither would his siblings. Carefully, quietly, with the utmost care he drowned his brother and sisters, then fled far to the north of Rjita. Since then his family has never been seen, it is said they still wander hopelessly, mourning for their lost children.
