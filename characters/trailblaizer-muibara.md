## Physical description

Her size is bigger than that of a wolf; 92 inches nose-tip-to-tail-tip and 53 inches at shoulder. Her coat is a jet black, ending at her toes which are ivory. Slightly small yet sharp eyes are a deep emerald, though flecks of crimson taint them. Her tail is slightly longer than most, though there's only a two inch difference. Muzzle is narrow, although not long. Her feathered wings are tall and scruffy. Long hair sprawls over her eyes, and follows to her tail tip in short spikes. Feminine muscles line her body, giving her a sense of power. All in all, the pendragon can be pretty - but only when she wants it. On her left flank are the Japanese symbols meaning "desire", or "netsubo".

## Personality

TrailBlaizer is one mean pussy when irritated. She has a short temper with just about anyone, especially "pups", which she despises a great deal. However, if you manage to get on her good side, she remains a loyal friend until she feels you've cheated her. She remains on the evil/neutral side.

However, this femme fatale isn't all what you see. Her thoughts and actions can turn morbid, oppressing, and even insane. Indeed, she has named the voices that speak to her: Florence and Frederick. She'd much rather be wandering on her own - living up to her name - mumbling nonesence than be in a noisy crowd. She's quick to strike, though the length of time between forgiveness depends on how she's feeling that day. Undoubtedly, Trail's known for major moodswings.

## History

Being born with the name TrailBlaizer, and the family name of Muibara, all her infant tongue could make of this was Trail. Thus, she called herself Trail, and came to be called so. Born into a tribe where murder was the name of the game, she barely survived the first year of her life. At age one, the herd had moved on, and the pack was obliged to follow. In the middle of confusion and mess, she slipped silently away into the night. Fate brought her here, and this is where the pendragon stays.
