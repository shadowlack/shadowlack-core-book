APPEARANCE:

Height-5'6 feet

Weight-125 lbs

Tymek has orange colored fur which sticks close to his body as it is quite short, though it keeps him warm. He has a few black stripes across his body, which he has incorporated into the tattoo on his right bicep. The tattoo shows a pair of dragonfly wings with a gear surrounding them. He has a scar down his face, from when his eye was sliced open by thieves when he was little. He now has a eye that shines green as it is filled with Fronima, which his mother used to heal the wound. His left eye is a normal dull green. One of the stranger things about Tymek is that his wings are not feathered or dragon-like, they look like a dragonfly's wings, the top half longer with the bottom half shorter. His wings move quite quickly when he flies, and he flies exceptionally well. He has a slight frame, molded into a more bipedal position after years of walking upright. He has a mane of orange fur going down to his neck, which has a slightly brighter color than the rest of his pelt.

HISTORY:

Born- 378th of Tessera

Tymek was born to a healer named Hitora and an engineer named Orgav. His father Orgav taught him everything he could about engineering and was the one who started him on a course in flying space vessels. He got his insect like wings from a strange mix. His mother had butterfly like wings, and his father didn't have wings. He inherited the insect like structure from his mother, and it was slightly diluted by his father. When he was fourteen thieves broke into his home, cut his eye, and killed his father. Luckily enough the neighbors called the police before the thieves could murder his mother. Tymek lived the rest of his life with only one parent. Once he reached the age of twenty eight he had saved enough money and bought himself a small cruiser, which he has equipped with two guns. It's a very fast ship which functions on Fronima. For easier access to space travel he has started to work for the USR. His job started only a month ago and he is now on temprary leave after doing some missions.

PERSONALITY:

Tymek is an extremely friendly fellow, he has seen much misery and doesn't want anymore to spread so he is as kind as possible to most people. He dislikes people who cheat. He is extremely persuasive, able to get his way with a few well placed words.
