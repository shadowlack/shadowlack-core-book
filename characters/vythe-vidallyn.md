Appearance
----------

Vythe has a rather strong and solid build. Standing at a tall 6'3" and weighing in at around 200 lbs (75 kgs), he can be a rather formidable presence. Vythe's pelt is a bright stark white which often tends to make him stand out in a crowd. The only markings on his pelt would be his crimson red ears and the sharp red markings that surround both of his eyes. Although the majority of Vythe's hair is grey, his shock of bangs are dyed a deep red to match his ears. Adding to his appearance, the back of Vythe's forearms also sport long "feathered" grey fur. In addition, Vythe has a pair of cool blue gunslinger eyes.

Vythe is rather meticulous when it comes to his self image. Definitely one who believes that "cleanliness is next to godliness." Not that he is opposed to getting his hands dirty from time to time.

Vythe is usually armed with never less than two pieces of weaponry. Being ambidextrous and rather quick on the draw, many of the opposition fail to even notice that they've been shot before they crumple. Although not particularly skilled in weapon-less close combat, he can definitely hold his own.

Personality
-----------

As far as first impressions go, depending on where and when you met Vythe, your opinion of him would be likely to differ. While "on duty" Vythe tends to be all business. He has a no nonsense attitude when dealing with his underlings and can be quick to both reprimand and praise them. Generally while in the presence of authority, Vythe tends to keep his tongue. Speaking only when spoken to. When speaking freely however, Vythe can be very opinionated. He definitely has his own ideas in regards to how things should be done. Control is something that Vythe strives for, yet at the same time he tends to excel when things are chaotic and disorderly.

Vythe is highly educated and some would say perhaps even overqualified for his current position as the Grader's Head of Security. He does his job very well though, so well in fact that there have been several attempts on his own life.

As Zamfir Grader's "leading crony" since 81364, Vythe has developed a certain ruthlessness in the line of duty. His steadfast relationship with Zamfir allowed him to become privy to many of the Grader's doings and secrets.

Although Vythe has rather weak offensive magic (choosing to rely on his guns instead), his defensive magic can be difficult to penetrate. Definitely a good guy to have watching your back.
