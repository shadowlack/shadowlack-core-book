## Physical description

Xing is a white pendragon. Her head is gentle pastel gray, with a small, obscure star centered on her forehead. her unusually thick tail is dipped in the same light gray. Juxtapose to the rest of her pelt is the burned black tattoo of a lightning bolt. She has gentle tea-leaf green eyes, giving her, on the whole, a soft look. 

In an effort to make herself unique, she's become an artist, whose canvas is her body. leaves, flowers, and unknown markings are painted onto her body. On a leather thong around her neck is a petrified shard of wood.

## Personality

Soft-spoken and usually quiet, this creature wishes solitude. Many conversations end up in awkward silences, so she's happiest alone. Though a few have found her true personality, you'll have to find it yourself. 

## History

Born as the only daughter to Diak and Hamell. Her mother was outspoken, and once enraged the graders in a violent debate. She was never seen again, after that. Xing, being the intelligent pendragon she is, knew the reason mom never came back. Her father took the role of both parents.
