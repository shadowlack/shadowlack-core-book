Description
-----------

Zidan is quite small by Yki standards as well as weak. He has troubles lifting things that an average male could. His flight capabilities with his wings, however, is above average. In comparison to the average Yki, his legs are more long and lanky, while his body is thin. Because of this, he is an exceptional runner.

Identifiers of Zidan is a plain, white fur coat with red stripes running from the 'Adam's apple' area of the neck to the base of his neck. His long ears have a smaller cross shape near the tip and a crescent moon with the points facing towards his nose on his forehead. All of the markings are natural. His body is totally clear of any tattoos and mutilation such as piercings. Jewelery that cause no harm , such as necklaces, are often hanging around his neck or tail.

His green eyes show only the sincerest of innocence, with a touch of paranoia.

Personality
-----------

Zidan has a love for music and things in motion. He has a respect for all living things that has rhythm, but will kill for his food. He is generally sheepish, and at some times paranoid, of his surroundings. He is very modest and shy to new acquaintances and will rarely ever talk, unless though written, or well rehearsed, words. He is not too keen of the sight of excessive blood or suffering or anything of a hideous nature, such things tend to make him gag.

Due to personal events, he is extremely wary of his surroundings, though he is also blindingly trusting at the same time. This usually ends poorly, often robbed of any currency and dignity. Though this would normally bring anyone down, he cares very little as long as he still has his bag, his books, and anything he's wearing.

Zidan is also a very poor fighter, a pacifist, and will do anything to avoid a scrap if at all possible. If not, he will try to use anything to his advantage, and since he is an exceptional flier, even amongst his peers, he will often take flight than fight.

History
-------

Zidan left the cold, barren lands he called home to pursue his dreams, creating a story that will be read by many, often times found writing in a book after listening to someone's life story.

Early in his life, he picked up a stringed instrument, which he plucks at with his claws to make music. After much years of studying music in apprentice programs with other tribes, he can effectively play any instrument, but not at a professional level. If tasked with a new instrument, he would toy with it for endless hours by himself until he comes to understand it.

At a point in his travels, he met a thill named Kanata, and traveled with her for a while before they parted, Zidan bound for 'no-place-special', and Kanata bound for the nearest town. They became close pen-pals, actively writing one another whenever they knew of the others whereabouts.

During one trip, he unknowingly walked through the black market of Bhim, having many things stolen from him. He eventually stumbled into Phet'knis Moi and both had an odd and uncomfortable lunch with a mind-reader.

Recently, he had published a fiction trilogy called The Traitors Call. He has made several book-signing appearances for this moderately successful series, though sporadic and at short notice.

He now travels by himself to destinations he had visited before.

Miscellaneous

Random facts:

-A certain piece of jewelery on his person contains crystals harboring dark energy. He has only just attained knowledge of this, but thinks very little of it. He had acquired it as a child and has since thought of it as an heirloom to be passed down.

-He simply CAN NOT talk to a female he has taken interest in, no matter what the situation. He either mumbles or stutters unintelligibly.
