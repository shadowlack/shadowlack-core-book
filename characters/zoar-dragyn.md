Zoar is a small [Pendragon](/species/pendragon), although he would never admit it. He stands about 25 at the shoulder, which is short for his age. His fur is a bright green colour and his matted hair his a light blue. Around his left eye he has a black star, and around his right he has a comet shaped marking. At the bend in each limb there is a tuft of pink fur. Zoar has earned two of his [Grading Stripes](/traditions/grading-system).

In Zoar's first war, he was badly injured. His left hind leg and most of his tail were severed, but thanks to Machina Technology, his missing limbs were restored, but at the price of a favour to [Talis Adamaint](/characters/talis-adamaint). Zoar's tattoo can be found on both of his rear haunches. It is black, and shaped like a little mouse. It means *little warrior*.

Personality
-----------

Zoar has an outgoing personality, but a short temper. Don't mention his height or the brightness of his fur and your fine. It is said that once Zoar exploded on one of the Grader's children, but if you were to ask Ryan, he would probably have a different story to tell. Zoar hangs out mostly with his younger brothers Radin and Seth, but worst comes to worst, he wouldn't mind kicking back with his sister Mirage.

History
-------

Zoar is now out of school but with no real ambition to strive for either of his trades. He has shown some interest in machina, but he has never really expanded on it. Mainly he just replaces the screws in his leg and tail every now and then. Because he is so small and sleek, he can easily take care of himself when it comes to fighting, so he looks forward to the enemy invasions. However he does more often than not, get too cocky and ends up getting hurt. He is close to his mother, and tolerates whenever she remarks on his size. For some reason when Ratha says anything about him being small, he takes it as a compliment, rather than an insult. However he would be less tolerant with any of his siblings of his father.
