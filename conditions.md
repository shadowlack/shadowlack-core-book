## Diseases

A disease is an abnormal condition affecting the body of an organism. While rather technologically advanced, Ramath-lehi has still not managed to completely rid itself of all diseases and ailments. Death due to disease is called "death by natural causes." There are five main types of disease: pathogenic disease, deficiency disease, hereditary disease, physiological disease, and magia morbii.

## Magia morbii

*Magia morbus* (plural *magia morbii*) is the term used to describe medical conditions that are magical in nature, instead of being just physiological or mental. That is to say, these diseases are caused by magical abnormalities. *Magia morbii* are often difficult to cure, treat, and even diagnose. In light of it's poorly understood nature, those possessed with these diseases find themselves facing social stigmatization and isolation.
