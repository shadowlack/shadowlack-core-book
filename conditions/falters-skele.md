**Falters Skele** (Faltermans-Skelebrand Disease) is a non-contagious genetic disease.

## Symptoms

Affecting the skeletal and muscular system, Falters Skele makes someone seem to age very quick. The bones get brittle over the years, the muscles tighten up. This makes one move slow, hunch over and eventually the worst happens, and your muscles tighten up so much that it snaps the spine.

The disease lies dormant in those who have it until it suddenly kicks in. When it kicks in, it is sudden, and them feel a sudden soreness and always tired. From there it is downhill until their deaths. The disease kills within 30 years of it becoming active.

## Causes

An extremely rare genetic disease, Falters Skele traces a very old ancestry spanning Ramath-lehi. Of the infected bloodline, only about one in 4 actually contracts the disease, but even the uninfected of the bloodline can still pass it on. The actual origin is unknown.

## Prevention and Treatment

There is no known cure, but medicines have been developed to slow pain and discomfort.
