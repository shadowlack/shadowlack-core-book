### 34,389

Erugata, the previous capital city of Boreios Sudesha was devastated by hurricane. Many lives were lost and most of the cityscape was ruined. After the tragedy there was no effort made to re-build the city until a century later.

### 9,000-10,000

Often portrayed as the earliest struggles for power, the Amoretti waged a war to conquer Boreios Sudesha and Notios Sudesha with the goal of creating a large enough civilization to unite the remainder of the world. The conquest started in early 9,000 when the Amoretti were led by the two sons and a daughter of the recently deceased ruling couple. The borders of their previously settled city were pressed out to take over the land from the base of the Nyonge Mountain Range to where the peninsula begins to tapper inwards. By this point most surrounded cities and villages were acculturated to the dominant culture of the Amoretti. The take over was slow, the leadership grew to a 5 'dragon group calling themselves the Amoretti Crux and they knew they had to take their time. Leaders fell and were replaced, the plan lay dormant for some years but the Amoretti never gave up any land and over the next 1,000 years they claimed most of the continent. The reason for their downfall is under speculation, after a few lost battles at the South end of the continent many written records were destroyed and three of the member of the Amoretti Crux vanished. A few years later the Enubarr, a large building housing the physical records of each battle waged and each decision made was burnt to the ground, creating a large black hole in Amoretti history. To modern Ramathians the Amoretti are used as a story to caution 'dragons to never get to greedy. Very few historical remains are left of the once large civilization, it is speculated that the population they were unable to defeat at the South end of the continent worked hard to wipe the Amoretti from history after their downfall.
