**Lelres** is often referred to as Ramath-lehi’s third broken moon, but it isn’t much of one. It was originally a smaller moon that rotated around Ramath-lehi’s largest moon, [Xabu](/countries/xabu). 

## History

### Lelres’ Rain

When mining operations were just beginning on Xabu, and Ramath-lehi’s first colonization project was getting underway, a few Adamaint Empire scientists took an interest in this whirling ball. They hopped onto a small space-faring transport and eventually set up a small science facility on the tiny moon. It is not public knowledge what experiments happened there. What is known however, are the consequences.

One of the experiments supposedly went awry, based upon found voice recordings. The result was an explosion so large, and so deadly, that it blew up three quarters of the moon. The explosion itself blinded anyone who happened to be looking at it at the time. Moon debris rained down on Xabu, destroying equipment, and killing many innocent civilians. The scientists who had also been conducting the experiments likewise died. In the resulting fallout, the Adamaint Empire claimed that they had no record that anyone in their service had been sent to Lelres, and that they must have used their name. Despite this, the Adamaint Empire was denied any further research facilities on any of Ramath-lehi’s moons, and future space facilities. This incident is often referred to as *Lelres’ Rain of Fury* or simply *Lelres’ Rain.*

Since then, Lelres has been deemed unsafe and off limits to all Ramathians. It is unknown if there is anything even there.
