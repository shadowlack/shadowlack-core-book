### Pjaun Nucajt

Around the base of the mountain cluster is a new rising cult that has been labeled the Pjaun Nucajt, the Dream Makers. They promote themselves as a peaceful group who have no desire to interfere with people outside of the group but a few dark rumors have started to float around concerning a few members who have not be heard of for over a season. Ever since the triple moon eclipse happen the cult has been growing in popularity. The charismatic leader is Teolun Heulm, who a few 'dragons have tried to investigate to get a better understanding of the cult, but all government documents about her report her of dying under suspicious circumstances before the age of 5 in the city of Tanastellos. Leading most investigators to believe that this is a pendragon operating under the stolen identity of someone else.

### 10,000

The rise of the Sun Dynasty was not well accepted as one of the earliest powers to try to unite and rule over the whole planet of Ramath-lehi. There was a large breakout of banditry, especially in the hill regions of the country where bandit groups could hide for years in the complex cave systems. In some of the smaller cities banditry is still an acceptable form of social resistance to a governing power that is not always respected.
