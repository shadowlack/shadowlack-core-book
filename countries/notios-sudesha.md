## Culture

### The River Tymd

The river that runs down from the lower mountains and into the large Sujpet Basin is known as the Tymd. The river is well known for the myths and folklore that are associated with it. Some locals believe that once every millennium the river will completely change colour. Others say that from time to time it will confuse wary travels by moving in the wrong direction, flowing uphill instead of down.

## History

### 22,145

For 10 years Sudesha found itself in the grips of it's most violent uprising ever. At the beginning of the 20,000s the continent was united under the ruling Boreios clan. An uprising was started and a state of terror and distrust consumed the country, turning it into a world where you could not trust your neighbours. The rebels, calling themselves the True Sudeshas, had made some big hits against important cities, but in 22,145 three of their key conspirators were all held hostage and things threatened to escalate. In the end, after a heated week of debate the rulers agreed to exchange the 3 prisoners in exchange for a cease fire along with recognition of Sudesha as an independent state. The 3 prisoners are famous historical figures; Tamlyn Sudesha, who went on to raise a second rebellion, Torth Khoi, and Ceueil Tsume.
