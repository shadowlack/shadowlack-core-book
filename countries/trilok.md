**Trilok** (*Drelåkh* in [Khellakh](/languages/khellakh)) is the southernmost land mass on Ramath-lehi, surrounded by the Kaushal Ocean. It is the home of the [Khell](/species/khell), an old Pendragon subspecies known for being both brutal warriors and genius inventors. In some ways, that duality could be said to reflect on the continent as a whole; Trilok's main contribution to Ramath-Lehi's development is largely a technological one, but it doesn't take much to find a remnant of the continent's violent and bloody history - both between Khell cities and against forces from outside.

## Culture

## Geography and climate

The climate of Trilok, being entirely within the planet's antarctic circle, is a cold and at times unforgiving one. Like Dhruv, Trilok has polar seasons, meaning that in winter there are days where the sun does not rise, and in summer there are days with no night. How long the midnight sun and polar night last depend on how close to the south pole one is.

### Cities

- Cronvint (Crønvint, "green winter")
    Capital
    Largest city
    Sometimes called "the fortress which defies the coldest winters". This name may have come from the fact that it used to be a heavily-fortified citadel. The city has long since outgrown its original walls, but the central castle, Cronvintok, still stands proudly after thousands of years. The home of the [Jarkorli](/genealogy/jarkorli) family and Trilok's ruling parliament.
- Mawerlok (Mårlok, "locked jaws")
    Formerly the capital of one of the old countries.
- Adamann (Ädamann)
    Takes its name from the [Adamaint](/genealogy/adamaint) family, despite being located a good distance from the Adamaint Empire.
- Polsuden (Polsüden, "south pole")
    The closest city to Ramath-lehi's south pole. Also notable for being the continent's newest completely underground city.
- Volithin
    Formerly the capital of one of the old countries. Takes its name from the [Volithin](/genealogy/volithin) family.

### Landmarks

- Pajukaldar (Natural formation)
    A volcanic crater and a traditional "neutral territory" for Khell families to meet.

    A castle at the centre of Cronvint, and the former home of Trilok's ruling family.

### Locations

- Adamaint Empire (Building Compound)
    The largest manufacturer of machina powered technology on Ramath-lehi.
- Kaushal Ocean (Ocean)
    Kaushal Ocean is the southernmost water body of Ramath-lehi, encircling Trilok and bordering the Sagar Sea. It is home to many Aquabat packs.
- Neurotech Research Facility (Research Facility)
    Ramath-lehi's largest science and research facility.
- Vaetfang's Jemd (Bar/Fight Club)
    A modest, slightly more out-of-the-way bar which is home to one of Trilok's largest fight clubs.

    The current High Koeyrn (high king) of Trilok; however, as the position does not hold the absolute power it once had, he usually works alongside Trilok's ruling parliament.

    A former military officer; now a member of parliament. Known for his distinctive appearance as much as his quiet but decisive nature.
