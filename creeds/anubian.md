**Anubian** is a religion restricted to only those who are of [Anubi](/species/anubi ) descent. Within the Anubi sect, there are thirteen Guardians (gods) of worship. Scattered throughout Ramath-lehi there are also thirteen temples which correspond to the Guardians and their substance of specialty.

## Beliefs

### Reincarnation

A core belief of Anubian is reincarnation. Some believe that their practitioners may be reincarnated Guardians.

### Slavery

The Anubians are one of the few on the planet Ramath-lehi that still practise slavery. While slavery itself has been abolished on Ramath-lehi, the Anubians have repeatedly subverted this. They claim that their slaves are not "True Slaves" as they choose to be in service to their owners, and that slavery is not forced down upon them. This is a major item of contention between the Anubians and other Ramathians.

It is considered a blessing to be a slave or whore to an Anubian High Priest, and an even greater honour to be accepted into one of the Guardian's Harems.

### Blood Treason

Practitioners of Anubian may not have sexual relationships with non-Anubi, as this is considered to be Blood Treason. The Anubi bloodline must remain pure and untainted by common blood.

#### Consequences

If copulation occurs and offspring is produced, the egg is traditionally sacrificed and given to the respective Guardian as a rare dinner. The mother of the egg is then permanently branded on the muzzle with a tattoo that says "Keita" or traitor, in the Anubian language. This is usually a black (or other contrasting colour) bridal mark.

High class women usually are exempt from this process, and leave the egg at the edge of the desert with the hopes that maybe someone will find it and take it in. If the mother is non-Anubi then nothing is done, as Anubians do not believe in DNA testing and such, and usually the father abandons the mother.

If the father does come forth then he is marked with the same "Keita" mark, and then banished from the desert. Banishment does not happen to females as they are usually then sent to be in the private Harem of one of the Guardians or High Priests, as low level slaves and/or whores.

#### Lukuo

All Anubi who show [Lukuo](/species/lukuo) mutations must be put to death immediately. They are not even considered to be appropriate sacrifices to the Guardians, and it is a great offense to offer one to a Guardian. Lukuo blood is considered to be absolutely filthy and high treason to the Anubian sect. 

## Traditions

### Oath of secrecy

> Rule 1: You do not talk about the Anubian Temples.

{.is-danger}

Practitioners of Anubian do not speak about Anubian or its related Temples and Guardians to those of non-Anubian decent. It is also forbidden to speak of Anubian to those who are filthy Anubi Halfbreeds.

Some of the Temples are said to have such a strong connection to Fromina that you can smell it. Some outsiders claim to have found the Temples, but when they return to the spots... their evidence is gone. The Anubi deny any and all existence of the Temples, and say their Oath of Secrecy forbids them from saying if they really do exist or not. Those proven to have broken the Oath of Secrecy will be put to death, and more often than not, the Ramathian who they divulged the information to will also be put to death.

### Thirteen Temples of the Anubi

Deep within the deserts of Ramath-lehi, lay the mysterious temples of the Anubi. Some can be seen today and have set locations; however, thirteen of them are hidden from view. These are the Thirteen Temples of the Anubi.

The Anubi that seem to live in the Temples are collectively referred to as the Guardians. Some of the Temples also have animals associated with them. These Guardians and their creatures are thought to be highly dangerous and should be avoided.

When the Anubi first appeared on Ramath-lehi, the Temples also appeared along with their inhabitants. These Temples cannot be found by normal Ramathians. The Temple brings them to it, not the other way around, via a very ancient type of blood magic that calls to Anubi. This magic also works in reverse by repelling non-Anubi and placing invisible barriers in place that those without Anubi blood in them may not cross.

While this blood magic does not completely repel an Anubi halfbreed, it is forbidden for a halfbreed to offend a Temple of the Thirteen with their presence.

Each of the Temples has a deep connection with Fronima, so deep that the temples are said to think for themselves. The Anubi instinctively know how to find one, but if another 'dragon asks them where to find one, they will refuse to take them or show them, as they cannot.

#### Thirteen Guardians

There are Thirteen Guardians of the temples. Each one can be identified by what they leave in their wake after teleportation:

1. Sand
2. Water
3. Smoke
4. Cold Air
5. Flowers
6. Whispers
7. Fire
8. Screams
9. Ashes
10. Soil
11. Pebbles
12. Dark Clouds
13. Blood

Each of these is symbolic of a different God in the Anubi religion. Another thing that is known about the Guardians is that they are all different. The Anubi respect them highly and if they seem on edge, it maybe because one of the Guardians appeared to them. At one point it was thought that the Guardians were gods, but as far as Ramathian sources show, it is unknown exactly what they are and how old they are. The Thirteen Temples may remain forever one of Ramath-lehiâ€™s greatest mysteries.
