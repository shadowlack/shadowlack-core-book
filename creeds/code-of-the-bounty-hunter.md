## History

The *Code of the Bounty Hunter* is a document which was created by the first 'dragons who took up the vocation of headhunting. The code was created as a set of principles to be followed to keep the behavior of the bounty hunter community in check and to prevent it from becoming something which it was never meant to be. It was also created to help put the non-hunters more at ease about the actions of the hunters. Lastly, the document has greatly aided in making the job of bounty hunting to be a more honorable business and has made bounty hunters in general more trustworthy. Although the current location of the original document is unknown, copies can be found in underground libraries. Despite its important history in the art of bounty hunting, the code is treated differently today than it was when it was first created. Even though there are some 'dragons who have memorized the code by heart and follow it word by word as was intended when the papers were written, other 'dragons use it loosely as a set of guidelines. There are even some 'dragons who completely disregard the code of honor. These 'dragons, who are few, are normally shunned by the bounty hunter community for their lack of respect for the code...

## Code of the Bounty Hunter

*I am a Bounty Hunter*. I do not follow any rules but these rules. I may temporarily follow other rules when such behavior is advantageous. If I disregard the rules written below, then I am nothing more than a scoundrel and should expect no better treatment than a scoundrel.

*I am a Bounty Hunter*. I have the power to take life. I only kill under four circumstances. I kill 'dragons whom I am hunting. I kill when necessary to defend myself. I kill when I encounter another hunter who is hunting the same bounty as myself. I kill those who do not respect Bounty Hunters or the Code of the Bounty Hunters.

*I am a Bounty Hunter*. I am a servant to those who hire me. I can be hired to defend the one who hires me. I can be hired to attack the enemies of the one who hired me. I will carry out all jobs which I have agreed to complete. Under no circumstances will I betray anyone whom I am working for.

*I am a Bounty Hunter.* I am not pro-[Grader](/genealogy/grader). I am not anti-Grader. If I am hired by a pro-Grader organization, I will carry out all jobs which I have agreed to complete. If I am hired by an anti-Grader organization, I will carry out all jobs which I have agreed to complete. Under no circumstances will I betray anyone whom I am working for.

*I am a Bounty Hunter*. I may search for 'dragons who are wanted by others. I will only do what is necessary to retrieve a bounty and nothing more. If my bounty is wanted alive, I will do everything in my power to capture them alive. If my bounty is wanted dead, I will do everything in my power to ensure their death. I will accept the posted payment for a bounty and ask for no more. If I receive less than what is due, then I will extract, by any means necessary, what is due to me and nothing more.

*I am a Bounty Hunter*. I complete my work with minimal collateral damage to those who are uninvolved in my bounty. I do not harm civilians who are not related to my business. If my actions bring a citizen to harm or danger, then I will do everything in my power to amend the harms or dangers I have created.

*I am a Bounty Hunter*. If I give my word as a Bounty Hunter, then I must keep my word. I do not break my word. When I give my word, I can be trusted to keep my word.

*I am a Bounty Hunter*. I do not follow any rules but these rules. I may temporarily follow other rules when such behavior is advantageous. If I disregard the *Code of the Bounty Hunter*, then may my fellow hunters bring their wrath upon me.
