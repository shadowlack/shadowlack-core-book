## Beliefs

**Daelarch** is the name used by the followers of this religion to collectively refer to daemons and archons - powerful spirit beings who dwell in a realm seperate from the mortal plane, *Fromina* and even *Kytlekh*. This realm is said to be of two natures; one, *Ari-cha-tellar*, is of the light and home to the archons, while the other, *Daemo-rah-tellar*, is of the darkness and home to the daemons.

Like the [Tanalist](/creeds/tanalism) and [Pouliarchist](/creeds/pouliarchism) gods, each Daelarch governs a specific domain or aspect, and worshippers pray to a specific one for a specific situation. The actual method of prayer, however, differs in one crucial way: direct contact is made, between the worshipper and a temporary mortal avatar of the Daelarch in question.
