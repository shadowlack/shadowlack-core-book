## Beliefs

This religion dictates that there is one divine entity, of which Fromina and Kythlekh are two halves. Fromina is Creation, and Kythlekh is Destruction. To them, Tanastlasei was not a deity, but the first *Dynir* - a mortal who transcended their mortal wants and needs and reached enlightenment. If the balance between the two is to be kept, and Fromina is to win over Kythlekh, then a Ramathian must live a virtuous life and strive to become a *Dynir*.

## Traditions

## Spread

This religion is best known for its *Holy Knights*, the [Blades of Dynir](/groups/blades-of-dynir), who are trained at the Temple of Dynir to be both artists and warriors. 

## History

A similar religion to [Tanalism](/groups/tanalism), and in fact believed to be the ancestor of it in some circles. (Many others believe they had a common ancestor.)
