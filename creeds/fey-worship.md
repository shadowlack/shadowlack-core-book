## Beliefs

Many [Feydragon](/species/feydragon) clans worship a single deity as a matron/patron deity, while acknowledging the existence of others. Alanamsul worship the Numegola, with the choice of deity influencing their appearance and potential abilities (so for example, an Alanamsul of Tejas may resemble a fish and be amphibious, or a polar creature with cryokinesis).

Traditional Azetsum clans have a culture centered around worship of Fromina and Tanastlasei, and there are those who pride themselves as holy champions of their gods.

Many Myshemd clans worship Kytlekh, but not all of them do; a lot of them moved away from this to a form of Tanalism. It's complicated.
