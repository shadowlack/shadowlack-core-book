## Beliefs

A less common religion which is believed to have diverged from [Tanalism](/creeds/tanalism). **Pouliarchists** worship a similar pantheon, but there is a crucial difference: here, each deity governs a single domain, and both the positive and negative aspects of it. For example, the deity of Health also governs Disease and Injury.
