## Beliefs

> Existence is suffering; the Nothing is peace.

This is the central dogma of the Rapitelli religion, which was outlawed as heresy in the early Sun Dynasty. The common Ramathian sees Kytlekh as something akin to an ultimate evil, and the [Rapine](/species/rapine) as Ramath-lehi's archenemy; however, Rapitellans take an alternate view. To them, the Rapine are akin to angels of death and judgement, ending the suffering of those who lived good lives and punishing those who were sinful.
