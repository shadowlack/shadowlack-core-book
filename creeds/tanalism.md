Tanalism is one of the most widely accepted religions on [Ramath-lehi](/Ramath-lehi "wikilink"). Unlike some other religions, it doesn't not follow a strict set of rules, nor does it pressure or canvas others to join. A person's individual beliefs and morals are never challenged.

Tanalism followers generally accept that the creator of Ramath-lehi was a god-like creature named Tanastlasei, and it is because of her that individuals are able to control magic and return to [Fronima](/Fronima "wikilink") once their bodies have expired.

### A Creation Myth

In the beginning, there were two entities. These entities were known simply as "Everything" and the "Nothing". They coexisted peacefully beside one another for an infinite span of time. Yet the Utopian atmosphere that hung about these two entities slowly started to disintegrate as each tried to better itself. Everything was greedy and it wanted more and more for itself. Gradually, within Everything's walls, "Something" began to form. Nothing became curious and forced itself into Everything, tearing up the barriers that separated the two in order to get a better look at this Something. The pressure that the two entities created by coming together was far too much for both of them to bear. The tension built up until both Everything and Nothing exploded, spewing their contents far across immeasurable distances.

Strewn also with the debris was Something. She lay in the mess created by her "parents", and wept, beginning to think that all was lost. It wasn't long until she realized that she possessed a special gift that neither of her parents had, the gift of thought. Something named herself [Tanastlasei](/Tanastlasei "wikilink"). Stumbling upon fragments of her parents, she noticed that they could be pieced back together. Overjoyed by this discovery, she started hunting for more fragments, forming Everything and Nothing all over again. Tanastlasei also fed the found fragments of Everything her ideas, while the Nothing starved. Worlds swirled into existence. The Nothing still starved, yearning. Tanastlasei continued to gather up various fragments, putting them back together as best as she could. "Everything" later asked for a name and Tanastlasei bestowed her with the calling of [Fronima](/Fronima "wikilink"). Tanastlasei, seeing it only fair, decided that she'd give the Nothing a name as well even though he hadn't asked. She called him, [Kytlekh](/Kytlekh "wikilink").

The fragments of Fronima and Kytlekh that still lay missing began to grow and flourish all on their own. Three planets were of particular interest. The first was the homeworld of the [Rapine](/Rapine "wikilink"), [Vaiuto](/Vaiuto "wikilink"), the second was the home of the Dragons, [Fesjym](/Fesjym "wikilink"), and the third was the home of the Pendragons, [Cyudiha](/Ramath-lehi "wikilink") (later renamed Ramath-lehi).

Tanastlasei had many worlds of her own, blinked into existence by mere thought, but once she found these three, she treated them as if they were her own children. She gave them many gifts and allowed the inhabitants from each world unlimited access into Fronima where they too could make their dreams a reality. Smaller, less powerful gods and goddesses also formed within Fronima under Tanastlasei's guidance, these were sent out to care for the three worlds and keep balance and order. These gods and goddesses spread themselves all over the three planets, each bringing their own gifts and hardships. Tanastlasei, being omniscient, looked over and took care of them all. All was good and well until it became apparent that Kytlekh was growing increasingly unhappy. His unhappiness directed him to the home of the Rapine where he felt something a little odd about them. Something ruthless. Something dangerous.

Deciding to test out his own powers, Kytlekh stole the Rapine's figure of wisdom and encompassed him in his nothingness. For a fleeting one eighth of a millisecond, Kytlekh's hunger was sated. Kytlekh immediately reached out to the entire planet of Vaiuto, intent on devouring it all. Yet, just as he was about to, an idea struck Kytlekh. He struck up a deal with the Rapine. He would allow them free reign if they agreed to bring him souls from Fronima in order to quench his hunger. Fronima he figured, would be able to end his hunger once and for all. The Rapine agreed without hesitation, and in order to make sure that they stuck to their end of the bargain, Kytlekh linked the Rapine directly to him. Now the Rapine were dependent on their "master", and all those that were unfortunate to be "killed" by Rapine would be consumed and lost in Kytlekh's great void of nothingness. Kytlekh, using the Rapine, waged war on Fronima. In the battle, Tanastlasei became severely injured in her mortal state. She retreated into the deeper depths of Fronima, conjuring up defences as she went along.

The Pendragons during this time were fighting, trying to keep the Rapine from getting any further. The Dragons, sensing that something deeper was going on, declared themselves neutral. They sealed the passages to Fronima on their home planet, not wanting the Rapine to spread into their realm. Tanastlasei, starting to feel some of Kytlekh's darkness within her own soul, grew even more weary. With an immense effort, she severed the link between Fronima and the Rapine home world. With their link severed and the dragon's link closed, the link to Ramath-lehi also became weaker. Now instead of allowing solid bodies to pass through, only souls could venture to and from the spirit world. Kytlekh, defeated for the time being, relocated the Rapine and scattered passageways to himself known as black holes in infinite galaxies. Tanastlasei, having suffered a beating, pulled all of her gods, goddess, and other minor god-like creatures back into Fronima. Fronima now secured, Tanastlasei ventured to Ramath-lehi for the last time. Once there she delivered a parting speech. Following it she bestowed upon the Pendragons the gift of the mind which would grant them limited access to Fronima. As she was retreating back into her realm, Tanastlasei made one last promise. She told the Pendragons that one day they would be together again.

With this said, her parting words were, *"Ukten fa maat ihiek."* Then Tanastlasei was gone.
