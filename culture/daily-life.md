## Government Identification

All citizens of Ramath-lehi should have government issued identification. Ramathian identification is special because it is specifically made out of technology that can capture the bio-signature of an individual. This makes them completely impossible to duplicate in order to create forgeries, and renders them absolutely useless if ever lost or stolen. Many of the basic services on Ramath-lehi require government-issued identification. Nearly all Ramathians receive their identification just a few days after they have been hatched or born. Some Ramathians refuse to get government identification, and thereby forfeit their privileges as inhabitants.

A very high portion of Bhim does not have government identification due to simply not wanting to deal with the government at all. The lack of government identification is the main reason why so many residents of Bhim are in poor health.

The vast majority of Takula also do not have government identification due to their very tribal nature, and as a result, do not often venture outside of their dedicated lands.

## Money

The globalized currency on Ramath-lehi is called khasi. It is a type of electronic currency that one then uses via a small card-like device called a Khorta card that is tied to an individual’s bio-signature. Most goods and services are purchased for in this manner. Khasi is very secure and cannot be lost or stolen due to the cards requiring a bio-signature in order to be activated (although once there was this one incident regarding clones…).

Making or recording a payment using the card can be done by holding the card against or waving it over a Khorta card reader from up to a few centimetres away, even if the card is in a wallet or a purse. The Pendragon then needs to place their finger onto the reader so that their bio-signature and the one on the card can be matched up. The reader will acknowledge payment by emitting a beeping sound, and display the amount deducted and the remaining balance of the card.

The country of Bhim also has its own physical coin currency called the Bhijan. While not many places outside of Bhim will accept Bhijan as payment, it is the preferred currency of those doing more illegal or unsavoury activities and wish to remain untraceable.

### Bartering for Goods and Services

Bartering is also a very common practise on Ramath-lehi. There are some residents who never touch any form of currency their entire lives. Instead they make a living by exchanging what they have for what they need - or by giving and offering favours. While this practise is not so favourable in larger cities, it is highly used in more rural and agricultural areas where communities are smaller.

### Royal Mal Mint

Bhim's most famous (and only) mint, the Royal Mal Mint, is located within the Terhesian Port. It is from that factory that the stable Bhijan currency is produced and controlled.

### Sample Prices

| Name           | Rural Cost     | Urban Cost     |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |

| Flavoured beverage    | 2 khasi | 2-5 khasi |
| Ticket to a movie     | 8 khasi | 12-17 khasi |
| Lunch                 | 5-8 khasi | 10-20 khasi |
| T-shirt               | 15 khasi | 20-30 khasi |
| Handgun               | 300 khasi | 300-700 khasi |
| Portable phone        | 70 khasi | 70-120 khasi |
| Tele-link             | *Unavailable* | 650 khasi |
| Economy car           | 3,000 khasi | 3,500 khasi |

## Food

It is perfectly legal to fish or hunt for food in Trilok, Dhruv, and Swaraj. All other areas of Ramath-lehi have a few laws regarding conservation of planetary species, so it’s best to be careful. While hunting is more of a sport than a necessity these days, there are still some Ramathians who practise it. Hunting is very socially ingrained in Ramath-lehi’s society. The vast majority of Ramathians take advantage of the planet’s massive wealth of grocery stores, fresh produce, and scientifically grown meat. It is extremely rare for a Ramathian to die from starvation - even in poorest parts of Bhim.

## Travel

Travelling around the entire planet (and off-planet) is both easy and affordable. The Portal Transportation System connects all of the various countries via a plethora of access nodes. It is even possible to visit two of Ramath-lehi’s moons, Xabu and Cussla, using this system, as well as the Therscatran Gate. Travel time is very minimal. It is possible to be (almost) anywhere in the continent in less than two standard hours. The exception to this is the Therscatran Gate, where wait times vary depending on the rotation of the moons and asteroids.

## Ships and Vehicles

Not many Ramathians choose to have vehicles. They instead rely upon the Portal Transportation System. Those who do have vehicles must have them properly registered with the government. Is is really important for atmosphere-breaking vehicles and ships to be properly registered. Ships without proper registration or identification will be shot out of the sky and destroyed. Land-bound vehicles that do not have proper registration will not be destroyed, but they will result in a substantial fine for the owner.

## Housing

Housing varies greatly depending on an individual and the country that the live in. A Takula could live in a simple hut in the jungles of Swaraj, or could live in an spacious apartment underneath the sea in Aurius, or even on one of the moon colonies. There is a really large variety of housing available. Not many Ramathians actually own their homes unless they are of more ancient, noble lineage, or are incredibly wealthy. The vast majority of Ramathians settle for long term rental agreements.

## Free Globalized Health Care

Basic heath care is provided for all inhabitants of Ramath-lehi. This is largely made possible due to regular taxation and significant contributions from Ajita. The only drawback is that you must have a valid government-issued bio-metric identification. Surgical procedures, medicines, and prolonged treatments, are all provided free of charge. This free health care also covers almost all major prosthetics. Unfortunately it does not cover the implementation of the widely popular machina prosthetics that are manufactured and implemented by the Adamaint Empire.

## Military

There is no conscription, or required military serving time on Ramath-lehi. Citizens are free to sign up with Ramath-lehi’s military, the USR, if they wish. There is no shortage of USR applicants and oftentimes it can take a while in order to actually get into the military. Working for the military is considered to be not only desirable, but also respectable.

## War

The citizens of Ramath-lehi are in an ongoing war with the Rapine race, however many of the commoners are blissfully unaware and (so far) unaffected by it.

The Tguka and Nujemat divisions of the military are the most involved in the war and countless soldiers have lost their lives over hundreds of years. A surge of deaths due to Rapine occurs  approximately every 6 to 8 years. Unbeknownst to citizens, the warring has been moving closer and closer to their home solar system. Many in the Tguka division are tasked with defending and preventing the borders from shrinking further.
