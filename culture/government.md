The topic of Ramath-lehi politics is often where many Ramathian scholars draw the line. Not only is this Art (or Science) of governing a lengthy historical topic; it is also a very dangerous one filled with deception, betrayal, blackmail, murder, and bloody wars. Sometimes knowing too much in the world of politics can be the catalyst for an early death yet for others, it can be the beginning of a long and prosperous life.

## Council of Thirteen

As of Dyo 14th, 81380, Ramath-lehi is being ruled by a political force known as the Council of Thirteen. The Thirteen came into existance after the deaths of the previous Arch Magos and Magosai, [Zamfir](/characters/zamfir-grader) and [Karryasa Grader](/characters/karryasa-grader).

Arch Magosai Karryasa Grader perished (Mia 48, 81379) during a magic mishap which left her soul ravaged and physical body consumed by the Nothing. In her absence, Zamfir Grader's health rapidly began to decline. Karryasa's and Zamfir's eldest daughter, [Koani](/characters/koani-grader), swiftly inserted herself into a place of political power. She worked as Zamfir's "in between," picking up upon her father's duties. Eventually it became apparent that Zamfir wasn't getting any better. Koani started to develop some long term plans. She had Zamfir transfer his veto power to her, essentially becoming the sole ruler of Ramath-lehi overnight. Not too long after (Mia 22, 81380), Zamfir too died. An autopsy revealed that he had died from a heart attack, or as the media liked to say, a *broken heart*.

The Thirteen, as their name implies, are comprised of Thirteen unique individuals, each hailing from different backgrounds and areas of expertise. Founded by Koani Grader, the Thirteen, unlike their predecessor, have "real" power. Koani, to the dismay of some of her colleagues, abolished her veto power. Instead of being the sole political ruler, she spread this power amongst herself and twelve other appointed individuals. The remainder of this power has been invested in an anonymous Councilperson whose identity remains unknown to everyone save for the individual and Koani herself. This anonymous person acts as a "behind the scenes" president, steering the Council of Thirteen in hopefully what is the right direction.
