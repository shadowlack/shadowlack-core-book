## Gloves and Footwear

It is considered very suspicious for a Ramathian to wear any sort of garment on their hands or feet. Those who do wear such items without a visible and clear purpose (military uniform, hazardous waste uniform, spaceflight uniform, warmth while visiting the poles, etc.) are looked upon as being untrustworthy and likely up to no good. Due to the hardy nature of the ‘dragon foot, they do not need much protection, if any, from the outdoor elements. Their footpads are tough and offer more protection than any regular shoe or slipper ever would. In many cases, putting on shoes actually decreases an individual's agility. It is also considered dishonest to change the shape of your footprint, or mask your steps with other methods.

## Kytlekh and the Rapine

While an unspoken superstition, it is highly frowned upon and considered unprofessional and crude to talk about the Rapine or the Nothing, Kytlekh, in public. It is believed that speaking too much about the Rapine will corrupt your soul and bar your entry to Fronima upon death. This is often something that is overlooked in Bhim, where much of the local vernacular is considerably uncouth.

## Legality and Acceptance of Magic

The use of magical powers is completely legal, however there are some public establishments that have strict “no magic” policies which will result in you being thrown out or barred from entry. Aurius and Bhim in particular have many establishments where the use of magic is off-limits. It is considered very rude to use magic indoors inside public establishments (such as restaurants or cafes), and also very rude to show off ones magical abilities. Many users who practise magic are very modest about their talents.

## Nullfires and Nobility

To be hatched without the ability to use magic, or without a tail flame, is very bad. These individuals are often called *nullfires*, which is a derogatory term for someone who cannot do magic. While most Ramathians believe that magical abilities can be learnt and developed over time, or do not put any stock in them at all, it is particularly shameful to be from a noble family and have no magic. This is largely due to the fact that all old blood is supposed to have a stronger affinity for magic, and to not have magic puts a blight on the noble family name.

## Sexuality and Gender

It is inappropriate to make assumptions about the sexuality or gender of anyone you meet.

## Vegetarianism

While vegetarianism exists (as well as other alternative diets) on Ramath-lehi, it is seen as being a little strange and out of the ordinary. Ramathians are primarily carnivores, and require a lot of genetically modified plants in order to maintain a completely vegetarian lifestyle. Pure vegetarian food is very uncommon, and it may be difficult for an individual to get the food that they want from the more popular food chains. The majority of meat that is sold and found in restaurants has been scientifically manufactured and grown from sustainable sources.
