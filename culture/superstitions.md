## Cursing the Magos and Magosai

It is exceptionally rude to curse the names of any of the past or present *Magos* and *Magosai*, and is said to result in the past leaders coming to haunt your dreams and make your life miserable. Not only that, but cursing them is also said to diminish your own magical abilities.

## Dying in space

It is considered really bad to die in space, as it is believed that the soul will continue to wander restlessly, unable to find its way back to Fronima. Bodies are never “buried” in space. To intentionally leave someone’s body floating in space after their death is an unthinkable act. Even hardcore enemies have been known to gather the bodies of their foes and dispose of them properly.

## The power of names

In the higher magic circles, it is common for powerful mages to use aliases instead of their hatched names. This is because it is believed that if you enemies know your real name, then they will gain power over you. Many mages throughout history had aliases and their real names only became known after their deaths.

## The source of Fronima

There is a widespread belief that Fronima is composed of living souls, and that by using magic, machina-powered technology, and other Fronima-powered devices, that we are actually killing those who died before us for a second time. So strong is this belief, that there is actually a subset of Ramathians who outright refuse to use magic because they believe that they are desecrating the remains of their ancestors.
