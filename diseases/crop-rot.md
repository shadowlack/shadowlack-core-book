**Crop rot** is known to be a disaster for crops and fields, infecting entire areas making food products unfit to be ingested by any living population. The bacteria itself can't be found in records until agriculture and a sedentary lifestyle was started across the planet of Ramath-lehi, it showed a dramatic increase once the world started to go industrial.

## Symptoms

- High fever
- Vomiting
- Drowsiness/fatigue
- Low energy
- Rapid weight loss

Crop rot was a large concern for people who depended on growing their own food or selling their produce for profit. The bacteria cycles on a 10 year pattern that scientists have yet to understand but have become skilled at predicting the regions of outbreaks, which has helped to avoid infestations that are dangerously large in recent centuries.

## Life of Infection

Once the bacteria has been ingested, it starts producing an enzyme that moves through the body, feeding on glucose bonds, mainly on any free sugar. This causes extreme fatigue, as well as nausea and vomiting as the body attempts to expel the bacteria.

If untreated, the enzymes continue to break down glucose bonds in the rest of the body until the infected no longer has the energy to move. Victims who aren't treated often die from dehydration or starvation within a few days. First treatments involved force feeding the victim to keep sugar in the system, this helps to keep them alive for a few more days, some surviving when the bacteria leaves the body, but the best treatment is being fed through IV while being closely monitored.

## Causes

Contaminated flower pollen is the main vehicle of transmission of the Dolkys Kyta bacterium. It travels on the wind for short distances, contaminating the open flowers it lands on. The bacteria has no negative effect on the host plant, but infection is spread to any produce, which is how the bacteria makes it into the population. The bacteria are not passed on through vertical transmission; plants grown from infected seed are not infected themselves unless coming into contact with previously infected pollen.

> They (Kylymiraa) unknowingly are pollinators;
> as they go from flower to flower, collecting nectar, and bringing pollen from one plant to another.

Kylymiraa pick up infected pollen from flowers that are already infected, then aid in the transmission to other plants nearby. However, after three days of acting as a carrier, the bacterium kills the small insects. Large scale mortality in Kylymiraa is a sign of an outbreak of crop rot.

Crop rot disease is not transmitted through pendragon-pendragon contact.

## Prevention and Treatment

Around 100 years ago, [Thorrin Jethro](/genealogy/jethro), a practiced agricultural chemist, made a scientific discovery of a chemical that was able to kill the bacteria in the plants if caught at an early enough stage of infection. Ever since then crop rot hasn't been too much of a problem; field spraying has caused a huge reduction of confirmed cases.

Signs of an infected plant is discolouration of the pistil and stamen (interior antenna or the flower). This is the only stage that can be spotted and treated. Once the blossoming season is over, the bacterium has already set up residence and cannot be removed.

While no vaccine is available, around 70 years ago, scientists at the Neurotech Research Facility (NRF) were able to create a natural antibiotic to combat the effects of the Dolkys Kyta bacterium, causing a huge drop in fatalities. Surviving the infection provides life long immunity.
