**Falters Skele** (Faltermans-Skelebrand Disease)

Category: Non-contagious genetic disease

Frequency: extremely rare Cure: No known, but there are medicines to slow pain and discomfort.

Lifespan Average: Disease kills within 30 years of it becoming active.

Target: The genetic disease follows a very old ancestry spanning the globe.

Affecting the skeletal and muscular system, Falters Skele makes someone seem to age very quick. The bones get brittle over the years, the muscles tighten up. This makes one move slow, hunch over and eventually the worst happens, and your muscles tighten up so much that it snaps the spine.

The disease lies dormant in those who have it until it suddenly kicks in. When it kicks in, it is sudden, and them feel a sudden soreness and always tired. From there it is downhill until their deaths.

Of the infected bloodline, only about one in 4 actually contracts the disease, but even the uninfected of the bloodline can still pass it on. The actual origin is unknown.
