**Magihaematophagia** is a *magia morbus*, or magical disease. 

## Symptoms

This disease alters the digestive system of the afflicted so that they can only digest blood - where the blood is from does not matter, but anything else is rejected violently. It is often believed that [Vampirism](/diseases/vampirism "wikilink") evolved from a particular strain of this disease, hence its nickname "Proto-Vampirism".
