**Desa Caabaj** is a music group residing at the [Therscatran Gate](/countries/therscatran-gate "wikilink"). While not the first band to be formed on the space station, Desa Caabaj holds perhaps one of the most colourful histories of them; it was formed during [The Flux](/history/the-flux "wikilink"), by some musicians who were trapped there and unable to return home.

The band's name was intended to be Ramathian for "gate keeper", but was mistranslated; the correct Ramathian for it would be "dusa caagaj". By the time the band members found out, the name had stuck.
