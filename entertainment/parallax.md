**Parallax** is Ramath-lehi's most beloved band, a fuse of rock and alternative that was formed by singer/guitarist frontman [Requiem Falahau](/characters/requiem-falahau), keyboardist/mixer Jello Yissin, and bassist Nell Asinio in Watani, Swaraj in 81377. Drummer William Gojgla joined a few weeks after the band initially formed. Falahau, Yissin and Asinio had graduated from Dragonbach's and joined together there. They met Gojgla as he was drumming on the streets for tips, and invited him to the flat they stayed together in. The band has been certified multi-diamond.

Rumours have surfaced that Requiem and Jello had an affair, but Falahau denies this, saying that he is gay and would never sleep with a girl.

Band Members

### Requiem Falahau

Requiem Falahau was born in Dhruv as a half-Yki. He moved to Watani to be schooled at Dragonbach's at sixteen, brought from the north by a talent search funded by the school. Requiem is known for hiis dress style - tight jeans and brightly-colored accessories, often going topless to show off his world-beloved body - coupled with heavy eyeshadow/liner and numerous piercings. Fangirls and fanboys alike adore and worship Requiem for his palpable sexuality and rockstar hot-boy charm at the television and tabloid alters. Falahau is always trying to write new material. He sees lyrics as a way of telling a story, and usually loves "dark stuff - anything twisted, weird, and a little evil".
