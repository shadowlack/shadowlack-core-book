**** are a trio of musicians from [Aurius](/countries/aurius "wikilink"). As their name implies, they primarily focus on writing and performing "music to dance to" - but with a minimum of electronic instruments, instead relying primarily on live performances. The end result can be likened to the jazz and swing music of early 20th-century Earth.
