Traditional [Khell](/species/khell) mythology holds that everything has a soul and a connection to the spirit world. While this is not uncommon amongst early Ramathian religions (and in fact partially turned out to be right), the Khell seemed to have a particular talent for attracting (or inventing) stories about ways the spirits of the world could ruin someone's life. Perhaps one of the most notable is the story about the **Ã¤gshoer**, or *eggwraith*.

*Never leave your egg alone in the frozen wastes*, priests and storytellers would say. The legend goes that if someone did, the soul of the young pendragon inside the egg would grow wrathful and become a vengeful ghost. Unless pacified with a sacrificial offering left at an altar for that very purpose, it would attack travelers going across the tundras. If those victims were the ones who abandoned the egg in the first place, the ghost would be especially vicious - *\[their\] frozen corpse and soul will be devoured, and it will have its vengeance*.

The story of the eggwraith is a cautionary tale, as a warning to ensure that parents, families and guardians did not get careless while travelling aboveground... and to instill fear in those who would consider leaving an unhatched Khell to die in the frozen wastes on purpose.
