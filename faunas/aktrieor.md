A large predatory bird, standing about three feet in height. It's legs are half it's length, keeping it's body high off the hot ground in desert areas, and allowing it to see over tall grasses in plains areas. They are usually alone, but sometimes a male and female pair can be seen. They mate once a year and have one to three chicks, which are usually found in or under a fallen tree with a sizeable hole in it, or dug under it.

This raptor's neck is short, and it's head and body is overall eagle-like. It has several feathers, like a cockatoo, that stand up on the back of it's head, but permanently. It's body and head are white, leg feathers, flight and tail feathers are black, and it's beak is yellow, with the curved tip being black. It's legs are a dull yellow colour, and it's talons are also black.

This raptor usually runs from place to place, but if it must, it can fly, though not incredibly agile in the air. It can easily out run most of it's prey, and due to hunting some venomous creatures, has built up an antitoxin in their blood to what little creatures they hunt on the plains and deserts. So while they are stamping the life out of their prey with their long legs, even if they are bit, they won't die.

Aktrieors are very hostile to Ramathians, and see us as a threat. However, they prefer the flight over fight tendency, and will run before taking a pendragon on. Their call is a very shrill and long-sustained cry, which they use to communicate with one another.
