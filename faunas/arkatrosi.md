The Arkatrosi is similar in appearance to both earths dragonfly and mosquito. It has the wings and tail of a dragonfly, the body structure of a mosquito, and it feeds the same way as a mosquito. It is generally an iridescent green or blue. Its larvae produce an extremely fine fiber when spinning a cocoon, these fibers are painstakingly gathered and used to make some of the most luxuriant clothing in the galaxy.
