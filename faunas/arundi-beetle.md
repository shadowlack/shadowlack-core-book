The arundi beetle is similar to the earthen termite in behaviour and a cockroach in appearance.

Living in mountains and other rocky terrain the beetle has an extremely durable exoskeleton that is a result of their complex digestive system that allows them to digest solid rock. The minerals and properties of the digested rock alter the colour and durability of the protective exoskeleton. The arundi live in large swarms that descend on a rock face where they borough their way through the rock, creating large intricate tunnels.

While original settlers in arundi regions had no explanation for the tunnel systems creating by the insects they were often attributed to ancient civilizations, aliens, or magical beings. Often resulting in the tunnels being inhabited by the discoverers or feared for their mystery.

The arundi have terrible eye sight and navigate on a very attuned sense of pressure that helps them understand if they are moving upwards or downwards. There natural instinct is to haul un devoured rock and excrement up to the top of a mountain where they create large nest, leading to an artificial, and extended mountain peak.
