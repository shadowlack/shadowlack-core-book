The Aujavh is an insect about an inch long that resembles the Earthren earwig, however this Ramathian version has small pincers as the creatures mouth instead of on their abdomen. They come in a variety of browns and greys and move about on 6 legs.

The insects are nocturnal, preferring to stay in dimly lit places during the day and hunting for their prey at time. The favoured target of the Aujavh is the ear of a pendragon. The insects feed on blood and the thin skin found in ears offers up easy to find veins for the insects to pierce. They steal a few drops of blood before moving on to find their next victem.

About 50% of the pendragon populations have a minor allergic reaction to Aujavh saliva which leads to mild swelling and itchiness. The more troubling aspects of the Aujavh is their historical role in the spread of [Rackult Disease](/conditions/rackult-disease). The insects carry the disease with no ill affects to themselves, moving it from one victim to the next when it bites. Historically this has lead to â€˜dragons sleeping with ear covers to stop the insects from being able to reach their ears to more modern precautions of eradicating the insects by establishing magical wards or pest repellant protections around housing units.

Aujavh are most often found in densely populated.
