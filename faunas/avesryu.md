Avesryu
-------

(Draco sapiens aves) plural avesrii.

The avesryu is a subspecies of pendragon that has been adapted to spend most of its time in the sky â€“ spined and supple wonders of evolution with hollow bones, a four-chambered heart, and vast wings. They have adapted over the years to spend at least half of their lives on the ground, although there are those who are seized by wanderlust and who live their days perched in trees and plunging through clouds.
