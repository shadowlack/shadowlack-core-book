The Azyssaj most resembles its Earthen counterpart, the otter, save for a few differences. The male Azyassj has a blue and black pelt and has three horns protruding from their heads; the one on there forehead is the longest. On his back are many spikes going from his neck, down to his tail. The males are much larger than the females, reaching from 4ft long to 6ft long. The male Azyssaj can also be used to transport small pendragons in the water and can be companions if they take a liking to you. The female Azyssaj are much more friendly and less dangerous. They only have one horn protruding from their forehead and reach 3ft to 5ft long. Both male and female can live on land but prefer the water best. Their young are born blind but not deaf. Azyssaj are very intelligent, if it wasn't for their vocal cords they would probably be able to learn and speak Ramathian.
