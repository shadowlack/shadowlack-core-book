The **blotkars** is a creature vaguely resembling the ceratopsian dinosaurs of ancient Earth, if a ceratopsian was covered in fur. They grow to roughly the size of sheep or goats. Wild and feral ones live in herds that roam the plains of [Trilok](/countries/trilok), searching for food. Feral ones can also be found in other parts of the world, provided that they are cool enough.

The blotkars were domesticated by the [Khell](/species/khell) in ancient times. They are so named because aside from their meat, they are most prized for their blood. When properly processed, their blood has a similar effect to alcohol on those who drink it. Thus, an industry of drinks based on their blood (often nicknamed "blood booze") has thrived. There have been debates and controversies over whether the animals involved are treated cruelly over the years; some even claim that such an industry shouldn't exist. Such claims are usually rebutted with the simple fact that Khell are carnivorous, and thus need to eat meat in order to survive - and in times of starvation, blood would be an easier resource to sustain than meat.
