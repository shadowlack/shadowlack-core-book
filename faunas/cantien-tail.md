The **cantien tail** itself is very small. Its scales oddly blending into the water, its nearly invisible. In contrast, their tails stand out wildly. Looking a bit like glowing seaweed, they can stretch out as long as most [Pendragons](/species/pendragon), depending on the age of the fish. Their colours vary largely from fish to fish. As schools of fish, they enjoy to play, which make them fun to watch. Long glowing tails wrapping and turning among themselves in the darkness of the water.

Living in the depths of the ocean, its near impossible to map where they actually stay. They are, however, common to see around the City of Aurius. A school may appear every few days, but to find one right next to the town is a treat.

Based on the small tails among the school, cantien tails have a fast reproduction rate. Its difficult to study them, cause its near impossible to find one outside of a school. They always travel in a pack, and seem to only care about playing and having fun. Unfortunately, even around the most obvious threat, they show no fear.
