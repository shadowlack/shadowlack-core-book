The cessi is a small, domesticated feline mammal that ranges in size from one to three pounds. They are well-furred, with large, alert eyes disproportionately large for their skull, and ears that move with their expressions. Cessi use a variety of vocalizations and types of body language for communication, including mewing ("meow" or "miaow"), purring, hissing, growling, and, most commonly, squeaking. Cessi are digitigrade, and move with swift, fluid movements. Unlike dogs and most mammals, cessi walk by moving both legs on one side and then both legs on the other. Most mammals move legs on alternate sides in sequence.

Naturally, cessi live in the grasslands.
