Very common to common. Large concentrations near cities and within ports and harbours.

It looks similar to a sea gull, but is more reptilian and has small sharp teeth for eating fish and marine invertebrates. It has a long pterodactyl like tail and large wings, and its feet are parrot-like and quite agile. The animal is considered a slight nuisance around ports and beaches because of its stealing habits and the waste it often spreads all over the place.
