The chuchip has a lean and muscular body covered in dark tan fur. It is a docile, hoofed plant-eater that lives in the forests and plains of Ramath-lehi. Its tan ears with a gray interior are very large and sensitive to sound. Instead of two nostrils it has four, something which is useful when running from predators because it allows the chuchip to get more oxygen. Adorning its forehead below and between the eyes is an orange spot and a crescent. Its tail resembles that of a lion, except much shorter. On its back, close to the rump are three large quills/spines that help when a predator pounces it. Another mean of self-defense are the black horns on its head.

The male is larger then the female and has three larger horns instead of two. The neck of the male is covered in a thick *mane* of fur and three stripes lay diagonal on their necks. Another difference is that the male has two tails slightly longer then the females one.
