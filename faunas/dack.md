A Dack is small lizard. They come in many different colours and many different patterns. They can be one solid colour or they can be spotted. They can be pastel colours or sun-kissed. When a Dack gives birth, the young are called gock.

The mating ritual is when a male stands on its hind legs revealing it's red underbelly. The male Dack sways back and forth while bobbing it's head to impress the female. The female signals her accept by whipping her tail from side to side. The difference between male and female Dack is that males have red underbellies, while female's have either brown or gray underbellies. Dack do not hibernate but during the winter is when the female retreats into her burrow to nest the eggs. The male stays with her to provide her with food. When Dack pair up, they stay together until they die. During the spring months, the gock prepare to leave their parents forever. A Dack stays with the gock until they are ready to leave during the spring. When a Dack gives birth during any season but the winter, they are called a Bloomer. The Dack's scientific name is *Lexujp Gekc*. A Dack flicks it's tounge out like a lizard. This provides smell. The Dack has excellent vision and can see colours as well.

The Dack can be easily domesticated though this must be at birth.
