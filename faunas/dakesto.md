Dakestoes are commonly seen in high altitude wooded areas. They tend to be black or a dark gray. About medium-sized, and weighing in at 20-30 pounds, dakestoes are friendly. When put to the challenge however, dakestoes can be extremely fierce and dangerous. These four-legged creatures often fight using massive paws with immense claws, and sharp teeth. Dakestoes are normally found in clans of 4 or 5. Dakestoes are known to only eat meat, usually hunting after the small creature known as the inth.
