No larger than a small deer, the daneyrian is of a very dark blue with black patches mixed with stripes on it head and back, a long nose, sharp, deep blue eyes, very long upright ears and one long white horn which makes it look a little like small unicorn. It feeds on grass and berries and will sometimes climb trees to get them even though they can't usually get back down. They have an acute hearing, sharp eyes and there extremely long legs which allow to run and give a hard time to predators so that only the most experienced hunters can catch them. they have very tasty flesh and some pendragons are ready to pay great prices to get their meat. Daneyrians live in small herds in plains and stick together to be stronger against the enemy.
