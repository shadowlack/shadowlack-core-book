The djirus looks much like a terran bat, and have a wingspan of approximately two feet in length (with their bodies proportionally smaller), except instead of having only rear-legs and a pair of wings, they have four legs (in all normal quadruped positions) and their wings. They are shades of brown or black, and are covered in short fur, not coarse, but not soft, either.

Their diet is generally that of fruit. They spend all night flying about forests, picking fruit off trees. Their four legs have long claws, which they use to both grip tree branches as they climb, and leap to each one, and hold their food as they eat. Like terran bats, they use echolocation to get around in the dark, and have keen eyesight, if they must be active during the day. They roost in caves, not far from the opening, hanging from their rear feet on the cave walls.

They can be pets for pendragons, because they are both fairly intelligent, and neutral in personality. They'll protect themselves, and bite, if threatened, but are usually quite docile. Regular feedings of various types of fruit are considered good for their diet.
