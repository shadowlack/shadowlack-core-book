*"As I sensed that I was Waking, the Niotie smiled sadly at me and said, "Your Dream is coming to its End." I cried out, but she shook her Head. The Last I saw before I Awoke was that she Glowed, and Faded into a Being of Clouds. It looked like a Canine, but before I could Get a better Look, I Awoke."* --Translated from the account of an unusual dream (author is anonymous).

This passage above is one of many counts of dream spectres, but it gives the best idea of just what they are. Very little is known about these mysterious beings, apart from the fact that they are secretive, and they seem to be beings of [Fromina](/Fromin "") itself.

Dream spectres are named because in each account, they are the creatures and pendragons in dreams. It seems that these spectres are shapeshifters, able to take on whatever form they please. Sometimes, they have even brought the souls of pendragons into the dreams of others. Some have been seen communicating with the souls of the deceased.

However, sometimes a few have actually found their way into the bodies of the living. Typically they act as possession spirits, and escape to Fromina whenever possible. These possession spirits' powers are much more limited than other dream spectres', being only able to take on a single form. Eventually they return to Fromina with the soul of their body, after said body's death.

Of course, things are a different story with when a Rapine attacks their host's body...
