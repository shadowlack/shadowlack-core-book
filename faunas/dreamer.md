> "Will she die?" she pleaded at the cloaked creature's feet, tears bleeding through her eyes. The creature turned to the young pendragon pup, shivering atop a woven blanket. It shook it's head *no*. "Oh, thank you!" the mother fell to her knees.

> The creature walked over to the girl, reaching into a small pouch. It began to sprinkle violet dust over the pup. With time, her fever would cool. The Dreamer had preformed another miracle.

Tucked away, looming in the heart of Ramath-lehi, The Dreamer lurks. It is said he performs helpful deeds for whoever is in need; but communication is hard. The Dreamer cannot speak Ramathian, but has observed some basic body language, and very witty when it comes to traditional healing and potions.

The Dreamer is believed to be female; *her* species is unknown, but it is assumed that she is the only one of her kind. Her age seems youthful at a first glance, but is currently unknown. She seems to resemble a pendragon sub-species, lacking some normal qualities. Her fur is a creamy white smoke, and her pupils are bloody red. Her tail is slim and furry, and rather short. She has very short claws and small fangs, and her hand is more like a paw. She is two legged, but can easily switch to a four legged when escaping danger. She seems to know what to do in various situations, and can use almost any plant, flower, or root in a crisis.

She, too, has triangular ears and a muzzle like mouth. She growls when pendragons refuse her help, but is yet to attack any living creature. She can smile, frown, she affection, and even 'lick' her 'patients'. Many try to seek out this wanderer, but she hides, adorned in her black cloak.
