It has a tail that makes up 5 feet of its length, and it's teeth are canine like. Walks on four legs, and often waits for an animal to walk by the water, or a pendragon to go swimming. It will wait at the bottom of a lake, Then it will lunge to the surface, often swallowing its prey whole, or biting off a limb.
