**Exowauls** are probably the most cunning of the jungle creatures. Rare in number, they are relatively solitary. They are feline-ish in nature, and may go by the coined nickname of *wauls*, because of the howling noise they are known to sound during the wee hours of dusk. Generally, they come in neutral colours; such as white, grey, black, and brown and are sleek. Their tails are long and tip off in a bright colour, often with shimmers within it. Their most predominate features are their ears, which fan out from their heads in an extremely wide, large fashion. Fur climbing from the ears drips down the sides of their skulls to their cheeks.

Exowauls are very smart, using their intelligence to catch prey. They can and will attack any moving, smaller thing in sight -- if it had a face at one time, an exowaul has probably eaten it. Pretty much, in the rare occurrence of one encountering a pendragon, they would not attack; they may stand their ground, being very territorial - but not attack. It would be wise, however, for said pendragon to split out of the way - there *have indeed* been reported attacks with sick exowauls upon Ramathian.
