Fenixes are much like the phoenix of earthen myth. They are approximately the same height, build and weight of a parrot belonging to the macaw subspecies. They have an exceedingly large wingspan, averaging 4 feet. There tail feathers are also quite long and the shafts of these feathers is thicker making them much studier as the are the Fenixes secondary method of changing direction.

When a Fenix flies the friction of the air over their feather creates a 'ripple' that makes it seem as though there is fire engulfing the Fenix and at times there have been accounts of Fenixes being engulfed by flames as they flew. The flames themselves do not harm the creature, in fact Fenix feathers have a high heat resistance on the surface of their feathers. Recently the chemical that made this so was 'discovered' and is now used in medical centers and science labs.

Fenixes may come in any variety of colours, though warmer colours (red, orange, yellow) are more common. The farther north or south you go the duller the colours will get, this is because of a chemical reaction with the inner part of the shaft and surface area of the feather. A subspecies of Fenix, *Medhsvliaj*, does not come in any of the warmer colours of the spectrum, only black, violet and midnight blue.

Fenix's claws are somewhat of an anomaly. Their powerful legs are covered in either yellow-green, yellow-orange, or blue-black scales that always end in black talons. On the front of a Fenix's claw are three toes, on the back is one. This have several joints in them so a Fenix may comfortably hold struggling prey or perch on a particularly odd shaped branch.

Fenix eyes are usually gold in colour, the only other option being a milky white signifying blindness. The tears that a Fenix produces act as pain-killers that mend any wounds they touch. The wound will not heal quickly, but it would heal fast than a similar wound being treated the traditional way. Fenix tears do not erase scars and imperfections caused by previous injuries.

Every season a Fenix will burst into flames and then be reborn from its ashes. This ensures that it stays healthy. This process is called moulting.

- If a Fenix is already infected with a terminal illness they will be reborn with it.\*\*

This means that technically a Fenix could live forever. This event is highly unlikely for several reasons. The most probably ones being illness, being hunted, and not going through two consecutive moulting periods.

Fenixes tend to be solitary creatures, seeing as there are never that many on Ramath-lehi at any given time it is unlikely that a traveller or researcher would see two or more together.

Female Fenixes will only produce one egg in their lifetime, which is why there are not many Fenixes. A typical egg looks much like a large ruby. The egg of a Medhsvliaj Fenix resembles an onyx gemstone and is a bit larger than a normal Fenix egg. These eggs will hatch 30-40 days after being laid and the chick will be no bigger than half the size of a blue Jemdrull ball. A set of brightly coloured down plumage will cover the Fenix until it moults for the first time. When a Fenix moults for the first time and the full wings are produced it will be able to learn how to fly. Until then it is stuck in the nest.

Fenixes much prefer to live in warm, dry, areas such as the Pwa, Uhai and Tmu deserts. Although if a Fenix feels as though it is in debt to a certain 'dragon it will act as a familiar and companion to that 'dragon. It will go where it's charge goes and if the 'dragon chooses to settle in any area of Dhruv the Fenix will stay there as long as it is not endangering its own life. It has been recorded that there have been several Fenixes that died saving their charges. One of the most notable was that of Ekahaujs a Medhsvliaj Fenix that died when it was trying to keep its charge (a godchild from a small Yki tribe) from being captured.

There have been reported sighting of Fenixes in the Gyakusatsu, though [U.S.R.](/groups/military) scientists have tested corpses of said fenixes and found that they were diseased with a type of illness that brought on severe headaches and memory loss that ultimately resulted in insanity and paranoia.
