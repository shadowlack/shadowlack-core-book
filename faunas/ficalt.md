The ficalt is a small rodent type creature ranging in size from 4-6 inches tall (full-grown) and weighing about 6-8 ounces (1/2 pound). It resembles a terran mouse or gerbil and they make great pets. They eat mostly small ground dwelling insects such as beetles and grasshoppers. They have no teeth, but behind their lips is a beak. The beak is ridged with small tooth like growths that help it to eat its food. The ficalt will also eat seeds if it needs to, but a soul diet of seeds will result in malnourishment.

They are very adapted creatures. They have no ears but small openings on the sides of their heads resembling gills that take in sound vibrations. These are very sensitive and exposure to loud continuous noise has been known to even kill the rodents. They have three eyes spaced out evenly around the head. There are two on either side and one in the back. It's front legs are situated right below the head, protecting the rodent's neck from predators and restricting the movement of the head, providing a need for the third eye. It walks on all fours, but prefers to "stand" or "sit" on its larger hind legs when not in motion. It has a short tail that helps to balance the creature when it stands itself up. Their fur is usually tan, yellow, or a light brown colour with darker markings limited to their backs.

Ficalt are solitary creatures. They are never found less than a few hundred feet from another. They are very common despite this, for they live long life spans of 10-15 years. During the mating season (Dyo to early Tria) a male will seek a female. A female will produce about 1-6 kits in each litter.

The ficalt are like other rodents, very dull witted except for the natural instincts such as "run" "eat" and "mate". The ficalt communicate with whistles and tweets much like birds. Ramathian scholars have discovered that this species actually has its own primitive language that can be learned through practise. The language consists of only about 150 "words" with very simple meanings. The ficalt makes an outstanding pet for young pendragons. They are easy to take care of, make no loud obnoxious noises, and one ficalt can live through a pendragon's entire childhood.
