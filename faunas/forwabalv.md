The Forwabalv is not amphibian, as it cannot survive underwater for incredibly long, however it does spend much of its time in rivers and lakes. It is built similarly to the weasel found on earth, though it has a many noticeable differences. For one it has a very strange way of eating, instead of hunting down prey, it enters into a larger predators mouth and eats it from the inside out. Despite this, the domesticated ones eat any animal organs you could buy at the butchers or at the pet store. A feature which distinguishes it greatly from most other creatures is that its birthing process is extremely similar to a khells, some of the Forwabalys are born with a shiny fluid over them, which covers their pelts for their entire lives. Instead of paws they have webbed feet like a platypus. Their tails have a split off, they separate into three tails. Their maximum body length is three feet, their maximum tail length is one foot, and their maximum weight is thirty lbs. They are popular as pets because of their exotic fur colours, where many smaller mammals have brownish black fur, the Forwabaly have seasonal fur colours. In Mia they have white fur with a bright blue facemask, in Dyo their fur is a grass green with a blue underbelly, in Tria their fur turns yellow with deep blue markings, and in Tessera their fur is orange without streaks or markings.
