A long worm-like creature, and it is white. Only about 90 centimetres in length, and 12 centimetres around it is not very big. 

The fripflik has one 5 centimetre long spike on the end of its tail. It is only seen in very dark places and the ocean living kind has gills under it's chin. Both species are blind.
