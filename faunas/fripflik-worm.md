A long white worm-like creature that exists in darkness. Bright light is fatal to the **fripflik**. Only about 90 centimetres in length, and 12 centimetres around it is not very big. The fripflik has one 5 centimetre long spike on the end of its tail. They use this to stab and paralyze their prey. All fripflik are blind and navigate based on temperature and touch. If something wet-feeling touches you in the darkness of a cavern, there is a good chance that it is a flipflik worm.

## Variants

- **Cavernous flipflik** are found in completely dark caves, often sliding around the ground close to cavern walls. When alarmed, they will sometimes scoot up to the side of the wall and cling there.
- **Oceanic flipflik** have developed gills underneath their chins and make their home on the ocean floor of bodies of cold saltwater.

## Behaviour

## Social structure

## Cultural impact

Encountering fripflik while fishing is considered a boon, as they will not tolerate being around polluted water, or waters that are too strong in magic.

Eating flipflik is an acquired taste.
