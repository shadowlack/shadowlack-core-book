Gids are the most common aquatic creatures that come in many varieties. They are usually small, flat, and colourful. They have a pair of antennae on their heads and have five fins. They reproduce extremely fast, but are also very common prey. Their skin is smooth and slimy and often patterned with various colours. Gids have one set of gills near their throats and two single gills on either side of their head. Their tails are strong for propelling them through the water. They feed on small aquatic plants and may travel alone or in groups.
