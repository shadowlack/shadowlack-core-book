**Gids** are the most common freshwater aquatic creatures and come in many varieties. They are small, flat, and colourful. They have a pair of antennae on their heads and have five fins. Their skin is smooth and slimy and patterned with various colours. Gids have one set of gills near their throats and two single gills on either side of their head. Their tails are strong for propelling them through the water.

Gid reproduce extremely fast, and are also very common prey. Although they have longer life spans in captivity, most gid do not survive longer than two to three years in the wild.
