A bizarre mixture of amphibian and mammal, these mutant creatures must live in cold, damp environments lest they die. **Grazieliak** have large heads, tapering to a pointed chin, and seemingly small mouths that can actually stretch the entire width of the head, and are filled with gigantic teeth. Their skin is slimy and rubbery, but they give birth and feed their young with a greenish fluid that is their equivalent of milk. Their oversize ribbed ears have tufts of fur on the ends, and similar tufts can be found on the lower stomach and where the arm joins onto the body.

Grazieliaks are bipedal, but walk in a stooping manner. Their lower feet are frog-like, webbed, and much too large for their bandy legs. Their eyes take up almost half their head, and glow a ghoulish yellow-green when the creature is angry. They have slippery tails as long again as themselves which have rudder-like fins on them. Grazeliaks can be green, yellow, or brown, and some albino ones have been reported. Their sparse *fur* is almost always a very dark brown.

## Diet

Some grazeliaks, though intrinsically not very bright, can lure unsuspecting victims into their caves, by appearing injured. Once inside, around five will jump on the victim and rip them to shreds. They especially like to eat [trinthili](/faunas/trinthil).
