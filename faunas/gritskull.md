The untamed temperament of the desert. With the imbalance of Pendragons using Fronima to their own advantage, the natural balance of Fronima in nature sometimes causes quirks. One such quirk is the embodiment of one Fronima source being out of its element.

The gritskull is a water elemental in origin, but given the earth elemental property in a second life. Insane water Fronima being reborn too far from the sea, usually near the violent Hrishikesh, often births a sea dragon on land. These dragons vary in size and weight depending on the anger, power, and past life of the Fronima possessed. They often resembles the large, four legged dragons of old, often with horned that double their girth. A gritskull often has cracks on some parts of its body with rushing water flailing around inside, occasionally splashing out.

Gritskulls are easily tracked by large clods of soaked sand, usually spaced apart as if leaking from a container. The creatures are a clash of two elements, and often die within two seasons depending on the heat. Although the creatures are Asexual, the reproduction occurs by chance of a storm getting far enough into the desert to encounter a dust devil. Because of their Fronima nature, the gritskull can multiply and increase the amount of water available only at birth, which depends on the intelligence of the Fronima being at the time of death. Usually ten to fifteen of the beasts are birthed at a time.

After defeating the initial Earth base, an equally powerful water base is left behind. Since it loses power while in the desert, the easiest way to defeat this second form is to simply wait. Depending on their size, it can take anywhere from five minutes two five hours. The largest record size for a gritskull has been thirty feet in length, ten feet in width, and fifteen feet in height with a horn span of twenty feet. The nomadic clans of the Pwa Desert often hunt the gritskull in reservoir caravans to produce salt and increase their water supply.
