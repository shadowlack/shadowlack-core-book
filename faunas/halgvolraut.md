The halgvolraut is about the size of the Earth seal. It has a very sleek frame, very strong front and hind legs, and a fluke-like tail. It is covered with a thick fur, but surprisingly has gills on it's head.

The halgvolraut has earned its place in the pendragon world. It is often kept as a *pet* by pendragons that live by the sea, and will often be sent to follow young pendragons that swim out and make sure they come to no harm.
