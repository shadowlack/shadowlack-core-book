Harok are leggy animals, with lean bodies reminiscent of a terran hare. Their lean bodies end in a "cottontail", and heads are topped with long ears that they hold back against their necks and backs when they move.

In the wild, they mate in the fall, and bear their young a half a year later, in spring. These kits are small, with eyes that remain sealed for the first week of life. Once the eyes are open, the little ones grow quickly, and are weaned 3 months later. They reach sexual maturity at the age of approximately one year. Males can mate anytime after their first year is complete, while females are generally only fertile between the ages of 1 and 5.

Mating is interesting, with the females in heat generally surrounded by a group of competing males. Competing males show of their strength by darting and leaping for the females.

Wild harok live together in groups that are called "warrens". These underground tunnels are complex and contain chambers where grasses and other foodstuffs are stored for the hard Mia months, and where the females rear their young.

Harok are kept as pets, and can easily be trained to run down a marked course between a set of white bars. As they naturally have a competitive streak (the males in particular), they learn that winning is good and are driven to beat each other. In fact, the most competitive ones can actually become depressed when they continually loose.
