Inths are small, round mammals with stubby legs making them slow and easy prey. Their fur is coarse and a medium tan colour that is patterned with darker markings along the sides, back and hindquarters, providing camouflage. They have hoovish feet and excessive endurance that allow them to walk long distances over rough turf, but not too quickly. Their tails are very short and hold no purpose.

Inths commonly travel in groups and are rarely seen alone. They have a keen sense of hearing, so may be hard to approach if not domesticated. They often make low grunts and if attacked, they will emit a series of high pitched shrieks. They reproduce quickly, keeping an abundant and tasty food supply for predators.
