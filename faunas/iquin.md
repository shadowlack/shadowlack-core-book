Iquin are very shy creatures. They are occasionally seen at sea, but not for extended periods of time because of their timid nature. Iquin appear to be small and covered in intricate scales, colours ranging from pale green to deep blue to dark brown. They have large, round, yellow eyes and thin flaps of skin behind their ears. They have webbed feet and gills on either side of their neck. Iquin have not been studied extensively however, they have commonly been seen in pairs and are monogamous.
