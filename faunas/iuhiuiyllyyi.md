They were *discovered* almost a century ago much to the surprise of the pendragons, what research has been possible has revealed that they were created millennia ago by an ancient empire who were trying to exploit the sea and so created pendragons that were adapted to the sea. It is believed that aquabats are direct descendants of the iuhiuiyllyyi.

They have long bodies reaching up to eight feet in length and they only have their front limbs which are large with long webbed fingers and are fully capable of handling tools. Their tail ends in a large circular fluke and they have iridescent scales all over their bodies. Their heads are slightly narrow and long. While they do have gills on their necks, they also have small lungs to help them out of water which they very rarely do now. They have huge eyes that seem to be filled with darkness as their eyes are dark adapted. They communicate by telepathy and with their voices which sound much like a strange singing. Their few tools are primitive and consist of metals scavenged from shipwrecks. They are currently being studied by archaeologists, sociologists, and various others, who also are building up relations with their engineered *sister* species. Recently, genetic examination has revealed that they are indeed pendragons, they simply have been heavily altered and adapted.
