The juktarr is a large beast, resembling the prehistoric Earth beast, the Stegosaurus. It is quadruped, the size of a truck, with powerful limbs and a small head. Decorating its back are large plates, in two slightly random rows. On its tail are four sharp spikes. They are generally a mottled brown/orange colour.

They live and wander in small herds, so they're not the easiest prey to catch. Add the fact that they tend to work together to fend off predators, and they are \*very\* dangerous. Even then, they aren't the most intelligent of creatures. In some regards, they're like horses: They can be used for work, but they're easily frightened.
