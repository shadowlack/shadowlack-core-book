The Kcalda is very similar to the terran ant, but a bit larger. They live in large colonies and have separate classes within them such as workers, warriors, and the queen. The queen is the largest of the kcaldae in a colony and the lives of the others revolve around her protection, well-being and offspring. The workers are the ones who take care of the larvae and bring food for the entire nest. Their diet consists of some fruits, other insects of about their own size, and other sugary substances. The warrior kcaldae are larger than the workers. They also have large pincers and stingers to fend off anything that would threaten the nest. The amazing thing about these insects is that when they are "injured in battle" they are able to take limbs from other kcaldae and effectively transfer it to their own body in working condition, providing the limb was not already damaged. This accounts for their long life spans.

Kcaldae are considered pests. There is no sure way to rid your home of a kcaldae colony, all you can do is call your local exterminator. Also these insects are highly hostile when they feel that their nest is endangered and will attack in hoards. Their stings are not fatal to any extent, and their sharp pincers can leave small red marks. A single sting from a warrior will only itch for a few days.
