Korads are sleek and muscular mammals with thin, beige or grey coats. They are primarily found in mountain areas, but also inhabit the forest and plains areas. They have prominent canine teeth and a pointed muzzle. Their ears are pointed and are very keen. They are ideal hunters, although they cannot climb trees, equipped with large paws and a narrow body. They are not very large, about 20 inches at the shoulder, and although small, they are excellent fighters and very territorial. Korads have long tails, that help them balance on cliff sides. They don't like the company of each other, so are rarely found together except when mating. They reproduce slowly and are very susceptible to complications when young.
