The Koroshiya are wraith-like, shadowy demons that claim to be the spirits of the ancient dragons that pendragons are supposedly descended from. Their appearance is often that of a long, snake-like shadows, with glowing eyes of varying colours. Koroshiya are able to change their size and shape at will. They, being spirits, are weightless. They have a dragon-like head at the beginning of a long, thin body, sometimes adorned with wings, frills, manes, horns, etc. They are spirits, and thus are usually see through (when visible at all). They are everywhere, though invisible to nearly all of the pendragon population.

They are drawn to wielders of Elemental Kinesis, who tend to give off the Fronima they need to survive. They are also attracted to those who are involved in dark sorcery, and those who study alchemy, believing them to be more suited to their energy needs.

An individual followed by one or more koroshiya will find that, although more tired, their abilities in these few fields to be greatly enhanced. For the most part this quiet symbiosis goes unnoticed; but in rare instances, the koroshiya will make itself known to a pendragon, forming a mental bond. Koroshiya will only be visible to it's chosen partner, unless it chooses to show itself. The koroshiya, in short, becomes the pendragons consort, often sharing long forgotten secrets that will grant the 'dragon more power. Koroshiya act like pendragons, being fully sentient. They have no true social structure, not really interacting with one another. The koroshiya are immortal, and cannot be killed, although a particularly powerful magic user may be able to banish then to Fronima; but in the end the banished koroshiya will find its way out of its temporary prison.

A particularly malicious koroshiya may possess a pendragon, taking over it's body completely. In other cases a koroshiya and it's chosen partner may bond fully, combining their souls.
