The **kratoaoaoaoa** is a creature steeped in horror and mystery. The legend goes that there was once a bad person, a terrible person, the scummiest of the scum. When this person died he left behind his body, as all do, and his body was taken by a dark summoner. The summoner supposedly tried to summon the Nothing, although obviously he failed. He died with the magical strain and only managed to take a small shred of the Nothing and put into the body. This was enough for the body to reanimate.

The kratoaoaoaoa is looked upon as a sort of bigfoot, there are sightings but they seem untrue. In terms of physical appearance most agree that it looks like an extremely tall [Pendragon](/species/pendragon), standing at 3 metres tall, it is completely black with glowing green eyes and has tendrils coming out of its body everywhere, these tendrils are said to have steel spikes imbedded into them. It is called a kratoaoaoaoa because of the noise people say that it makes. It is said to have the same soulsucking effect as a [Rapine](/species/rapine).
