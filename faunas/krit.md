Though originally adapted for hot desert sands, the krit has now begun appearing in jungle and even forest areas. Krit are small lizards, growing up to 28 centimetres in length. They have fine scales, a light green with a "gold dust" sheen upon their backs. They evolved as sand-burrowers, living safely under the sand out of the sun's glare until night, when they ate grubs and insects that emerged. Many do still live like this, but in jungle and forest areas their feet have adapted small hooks so they can scoot up trees and hide in the leaves, feeding on [szjimit](/faunas/szjimit) and other insects hiding in the bark. They are not very sociable creatures, and are rarely seen together although a great number can occupy one territory. Their meat is very tender, and they are a principle diet component of [mierenu](/faunas/mierenu). Their eyes are slitted, and they have two sets of eyelids - one transparent pair, allowing them to see in sandstorms without being blinded, and a pair of normal ones that go on top. If an enemy grabs their tail, it detaches and wriggles around, while the krit makes its escape. The tail will grow back very fast, as will any other lost limbs.
