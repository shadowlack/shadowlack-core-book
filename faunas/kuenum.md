(NOT found in the ocean, just in water systems closely connecting to the oceans)

The saltwater Kuenum looks much like a terran alligator in both build and colour, however, they are lighter in colour than their saltwater cousins. It has no true upper range in size in which it can be found, but the largest to date, was 13ft (3.9m) long. They average 9ft (2.7m), and are generally much larger than their freshwater cousins.

They are opportunist hunters, and lie in wait just under the water's edge for some animal to get a drink, before attacking. They are capable of moving on land quite quickly despite their size, and will chase prey for quite a ways away from the water's edge. They are generally solitary animals, but can sometimes be seen in pairs, especially during breeding season, or if the females have chosen a similar nesting spot.

Their eggs are laid on land in clutches of about 50 or more. These nests are guarded viciously by the mother but even so, are often raided when she is off hunting.
