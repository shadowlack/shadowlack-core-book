About five feet at the shoulder, these muscular quadrupeds resemble Earth bison in shape, but with very long black horns. Horns on males can sometimes reach lengths of half their body length, females are noticeably smaller.

They are many shades of brown, and feast on plants most times of day. They travel in herds consisting of several males, females, and the female's young. The only time they are hostile to one another is during rut, where males and females alike fight for supremacy and the right to breed. They give live birth to one calf, sometimes twins. They are neutral in personality until threatened, then they turn into fighting machines, and will chase an aggressor until satisfied. Males do most of the chasing while the females and a male or two, circle around young calves to protect them.

It is very difficult to bring one of these brutes down, especially alone, simply because they are very agile despite their size, and their horns can easily impale. But if one is successful in killing a kyf, one must get it out of sight of the other herd members, for even in death, the live members of the dead kyf's herd will try to protect their deceased family member. Once stowed away, the meat can last for days and is rather good: especially if the animal is in prime condition. The meat isn't stringy or excessively fatty. The hide is also capable of being tanned and turned to leather for various purposes.
