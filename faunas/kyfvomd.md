The Kyfvomd is an extremely unique animal. The Kyfvomd has a head much like Earths cow, arms like a kangaroos, except longer, going down to about its thighs. It has hoofed feet, with legs similar to a kangaroos. Females have udders on their stomach which produce an extremely sweet milk, and the males have pouches to carry children. They are bipeds, although they lean downwards like a kangaroo. They can run extremely quickly, they escape predators within seconds. The most unique feature of the Kyfvomd is that it has various fungus growing out of its back, the most frequent of these is the Gartarp, although when a Gartarp grows on a Kyfvomd it turns red and white instead of red and yellow. They have the same pattern on their fur as cows, although brown and white is replaced with white and red. Their meat is highly valued, as it tastes like steak with mushroom sauce.
