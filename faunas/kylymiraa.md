A small insect, the largest are about an inch in length, but average half to three quarters an inch long. They are black and yellow striped, and live in colonies of a hundred or so, wherever they can. Usually they will live in holes in trees (alive, or fallen).

They unknowingly are pollinators; as they go from flower to flower, collecting nectar, and bringing pollen from one plant to another.

If left undisturbed, they will be very glad to leave one alone. But should their nest be unknowingly, or purposefully, trampled upon, beware, because in their idiocy, their minds will then turn to a determined *protect*, and will sting the assumed aggressor. A few stings will result in itchy and painful red bumps wherever stung, but enough stings (several hundred) can be fatal.
