Lesser koroshiya are named for their resemblance to true [koroshiya](/faunas/koroshiya), although they are not related. Lesser koroshiya are often simply referred to as koroshiya.

Their bodies are built like long snakes, although they possess fore, and rear legs. These legs are small, clawed and the toes are webbed. Every lesser koroshiya has a stiff, erect fin that follows their spine. Their end of their tail is slightly flattened vertically to aid in swimming.

Koroshiya come in horned, crested, spiny, and winged. Winged koroshiya do not actually possess wings, rather they have large, decorative fins emerging from just behind their forelegs. They come in varying patterns and colours, nearly spanning the entire rainbow.

Koroshiya require a readily available source of water at all times, but are able to leave the water for days at a time as long as they do not get too dehydrated.

Lesser koroshiya can breed at any point in the year and, following a three month gestation, give birth to a litter of 3-4 pups. The pups remain with the mother for another month or so before setting out on their own.

Males tend to be slightly longer than females, but females are larger in girth to accommodate litters of pups during pregnancy. On land, lesser koroshiya calls sound like the chirps and twittering calls of songbirds.

Lesser koroshiya are highly social creatures, and are easily domesticated by even the most inexperienced of pendragons. They make excellent pets, highly affectionate, easily cared for and easy to breed.
