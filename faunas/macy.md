The macy is uncommon in the wild, but can be domesticated very easily. The resemble a domestic feline; basic triangular ears, a tail, and a fair range of coat colours. Some colours and/or textures to be extremely exotic and rare, resulting in various coat colour and texture competitions across Ramath-lehi.

Macy claws are extremely sharp and thick. They cannot be trimmed or cut; luckily, they tend to stop growing around the age of three or four years. In the wild, the Macy is a rather tender and delicate meat. They fend of predators with their claws, but nothing can defend them from barbaric pendragons lacking meat. Various societies are trying to defend the macy, and breeding programs have been stationed randomly across Ramath-lehi.

The macy's triangular ears are large than the domestic felines', and are extremely sensitive. Their long whiskers are excellent for sensory, but it is strictly required to trim their whiskers if desiring to enter a competition.

There are four known macy species to pendragons: Aquatic, Mendrimade (rare), Cheik, and Mansroc. Mansroc is common, dwelling in forest. Its coat colours range to almost any colour, and it represents a rather average appearance. The Aquatic are water dwellers, in freshwater streams and ponds. They cannot adapt to saltwater; they survive off of water grasses, and come upon land often (the have lungs, not gills). The Mendrimade is rare; the only thing separating it from the Mansroc is its exotic colour and thick coat. And the Cheik: dwelling in warm climates, with few patches of tin fur and a hairless body.

Mating rituals occur in early Dyo; with a litter of two to five kittens. This is common, and no average words can describe it.
