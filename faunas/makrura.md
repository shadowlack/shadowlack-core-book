The makrura is a waterborne insectoid. They look like terran lobsters, but they have large eyes and beaks resembling those of birds of prey.

The domestic makrura grows to a length about three feet. They come in different shades of red, from pink to vine red. This is the only makrura that can be tamed, hence it's name.
