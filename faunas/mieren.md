50 cm long, including their gargantuan prehensile tails, mierenu live anywhere where there is trees, but prefer dense jungle above all else. They are very nimble, and delight in jumping from branch to branch or surprising ground-dwelling animals from above - mischief is their main objective in life. Their fur is a yellowish-khaki colour, but varies with the type of forest they live in. Mierenu feed on insects, small lizards, berries, certain types of bark and leaf, and scavenged meat from other kills. Mierenu are rarely eaten themselves, as they have a very bitter taste. They have four fingers to each hand, each with sharp claws that allow them to get a grip on prey. As they get older, the tuft of fur on their heads get much longer, so it is possible to tell the age of one from looking at it.

Mierenu live in treehouses, which are groups of around three hollowed-out trees. Each group houses a tribe of mierenu, which consists of one dominant male mieren, about two subordinate males, and up to 13 females and their offspring. The dominant male has total breeding rights, so the subordinates are lucky to even have one mate. Due to this, when male cubs reach maturity, they go off and start their own tribe, if they have not already been killed.
