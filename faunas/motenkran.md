Motenkrani are large earth elementals found in Trilok. They take the form of heavily-built quadrapeds made of frozen soil and rock, with occasional bits of moss and glowing eyes. Beyond this, however, their appearances can vary; some resemble sculptures of animals, some look like suits of armour, and so on. They are also self-aware and capable of speech.
