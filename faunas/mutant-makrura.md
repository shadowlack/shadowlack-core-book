The makrura is a waterborne insectoid. They look like terran lobsters, but they have large eyes and beaks resembling those of birds of prey.

The mutant makrura never stops growing. This is the most hostile of the Makrura, and the only of them who ever has killed a pendragon. They're black in colour, but when it's dark, they emit an acid green light. Their limbs are disproportionate and mutilated.
