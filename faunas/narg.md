A hulking beast, six foot tall while all fours. The difference of the narg doesn't end with the size, but with long horns that protrude from their neck and slightly pass their face. Their head is closely related to the bulldog, but has a larger mouth that can be unhinged to eat larger meat. The size of the teeth, which were found at some murder sites, seems to match some of the wounds that rip whole stomachs out with a single rip.
