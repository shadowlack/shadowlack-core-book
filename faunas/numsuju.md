The **numsuju**, commonly referred to as the *sea fae*, is a mysterious creature. Numsuju are classified as merely rare because while across the world they are extremely difficult to find, they live in great numbers in cave systems under the frozen seas of [Dhruv](/countries/dhruv). They are also far more populous in the Krishna Sea than in most of the world. The only other place where you can find colonies is the Sagar sea. 

Numsuju are digitrades, having the same basic pelvic structure of a [Pendragon](/species/pendragon), being able to stand up on its hind legs and run in the same way as quadrapeds. The maximum height of a numsuju standing on its hind legs is about 50 to 60 centimetres, and while on all fours it is about 20 to 38 centimetres tall. The skin of a numsuju is similar to that of a frogs, though much smoother and less slimy. The coloration differs from regions, freshwater numsuju have greenish to blueish skin, those living in northern waters are either white or light blue, and those living in tropical waters come in extremely varied bright colors. The fingers of the numsuju resemble those of a geckos, allowing them to climb up walls and such. Their cranial structure resembles that of a frogs mixed with a newt, and then made slightly longer. Around the neck and lower head area they have a set of vibrissae. They bristle from middle of their head to the middle of their back. Their eyes are large, round and completely black. In the side of their cheeks there are small pouches which produce oxygen by using Fronima. These are used for extended periods of swimming. they have tails like that of eels, which produce a psychedelic toxin. The toxin is generally held under the skin, though moments of high stress release it. It causes no lasting damage. The reason they are referred to as fae is because they have wings. Wings not used for flying, but for aquatic maneuverability. They most closely resemble the wings of a flying fish. They have two sets of wings, one on their backs and one on their side. They have internal ears.


## Behaviour

## Reproduction

They are born from eggs, although their egg is extremely unique. The shell itself is in the physical world, although the embryo inside is located in Fronima, so if the egg is crushed they can simply mature in Fronima. During menstruation the female will spit pearls out of her mouth. These are very pretty and have the same hue as the females skin. These pearls are made out of organic fluids which are produced during menstruation, and the pearls will only be produced if the female does not engage in sexual intercourse for extended periods of time during menstruation.

## Social structure

The freshwater variety is the most rare, being found in numbers of only two or three small packs per continent. They are extremely intelligent, having about the same level of intelligence as a [tmyfrommi](/faunas/tmyfrommi), some would say that they are even smarter. They generally live in either packs or colonies. Freshwater varieties live in small family packs, at their largest three members. There are large but hidden colonies living in the frozen depths of the seas near Dhruv, and also in the Sagar and Krishna seas.

## Cultural impact

The [blood of a numsuju](/natural-resources/numsuju-blood) is highly magical, it has the unique ability to absorb viruses if drank, and then when the blood is passed a person would be free of the virus. Their blood can also be used in alchemy.
