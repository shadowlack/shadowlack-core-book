This gangly mammal is about the size of a deer, only with a much longer and more flexible neck. Its fur is very coarse and thinly distributed, and is a sandy-ochre colour. Near the top of the head, this fur is denser and darker, almost hiding the skull protrusion resembling a horn, and on the back there are sometimes a few stripes. Very similar to the earth camel as well, it has long legs that appear to have been built entirely of knees. It has four wide cloven hooves, the back pair having two extra **toes**. Though of medium intellect, these creatures have a very weak grip on sanity and can at any moment go off into a stampede or start up a symphony of piercing brays and snorts which can last for hours. They travel in herds of around twenty.
