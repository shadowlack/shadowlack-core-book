Orincs are enormous marine predators that feed mainly on gids, but will eat anything alive. They are most commonly recognized by their four eyes, two small and two large. They have two rows of teeth and an extremely strong jawbone. Orinc have two ears as well, small, rounded ones on either side of their head. They have two short forepaws with webbed toes, and no hind legs, but instead a large, flat tail. They are mammals and breathe air, but can hold their breaths for over an hour.

Orincs have short tempers and live alone, but may come together and fight when feeding. When two orincs fight, it is usually to the death. They do not reproduce often, but when young are born, the mother orinc will protect them until they are large enough to defend themselves. The mothers are extremely protective over their young and will fight to the death if another creature threatens her offspring.
