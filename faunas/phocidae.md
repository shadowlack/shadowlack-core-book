Phocidae resemble seals, with their sleek flexible bodies, and strong flippers. Phocidae are chocolate brown with black speckling along their entire body, their flippers being mostly black, especially along the back edge. Their nose is black, and their eyes are a deep brown, matching their fur.

Phocidae spend most of their time in the water, only spending time out of it to rest, or to give birth. Their completely black pups are born on the beaches of the continents and islands around the equator. Their diet consists entirely of aquatic zoological species; they are an important part of keeping the prey population numbers even, and also an important prey source, themselves.
