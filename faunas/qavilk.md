The qavilk bears a resemblance to both the dingo and the aardvark. It is about the size of a dingo, having the same colouration as an African Wild Dog on Earth, while having the black fleshy feet of an aardvark. They have a snout like that of an aardvarks, though the rest of their muzzle resembles the muzzle of a dingo. They hunt for insects with their extremely long tongues. They have a very unique way to get into hives on trees, they have extremely powerful legs which are built to jump up vertically almost twenty feet.
