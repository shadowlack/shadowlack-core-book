The rafkal is an animal which was used in the ancient times as a sort of pack animal. It is now commonly used to traverse mountains were vehicles cannot travel.

The rafkal is hoofed, and covered in golden brown fur, although it has a mane of feathers, usually in white or brown, which completely covers its head. The only part of its face that is uncovered is the region around its eyes and mouth. While completely covering its muzzle, the feathers only cover the top half of its body. The feathers droop down to about their knees. They have beaks instead of mouths, and they seem to be a strange link between equestrians and avians. They give live birth as you would expect an animal to. They have cloven hoofs which allow for easy mountain travel.
