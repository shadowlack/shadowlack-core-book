Rheyants are large and bulky covered in thin, coarse fur, usually deep rust coloured. Males have several horns lining their foreheads, but are generally peaceful animals and only fight if provoked. They feed on grasses mainly, but also consume other plants. They have large, round feet and thick, strong legs. They don't normally reside with each other, but it is usually not problematic if they pass each other by.
