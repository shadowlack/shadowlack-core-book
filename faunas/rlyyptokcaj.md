*Rlyyptokcaj*, also known as *bloodsucker*, is about two and a half inches long. It's body is covered in small spikes, which it attaches itself to its prey with. It has two legs, both of which end in spikes that contain a poison which paralyzes its prey. It has a long neck for something so small, and a circle for its head. It has large black eyes for seeing in the dark, and on its head is another spike like the ones on its legs. It has transparent wings for flying.

Rlyyptokcaj hunt at night, slipping through the smallest crack in the window to feed on anything it finds. They are intelligent, so they don't fall for traps of any kind. Once they latch onto you, it's almost impossible to get them off. As it feeds, strange designs run from where it's attached to you all over your body. If the designs cover your entire body, you're as good as dead.
