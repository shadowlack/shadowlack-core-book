A manifestation of lightning Fromina, appearing as a small, self-contained ball of electricity. They do not eat, reproduce or show any signs of being actual life forms, but they *are* clearly intelligent - all the way up to understanding speech, despite being incapable of it themselves. Ruldhemi can give off electrical discharges, and can give off light. Some appear to be willing to lead pendragons along paths and to safety; some try to lead them into danger.
