Sagnarires are common creatures found throughout the continent of Swaraj; they can be domesticated and tamed rather easily and adapt to any household easily. They resemble small rodent like felines, and their fur colours range from black, grey, brown, white, and sometimes red or orange. Their small triangular ears are extremely keen, unlike their eyes which tend to fail them at times.

The sagnarir is an unusual creature; their small teeth aren't sharp at all and they rarely eat meat. Their diet is usually based off of small plants and large plant roots. They use their large retractable claws for digging, as they are usually found underground in their burrows. Since they are often found in colonies, or groups of up to ten to thirty family members, they are never alone. hey are extremely loyal to not only friends and family, but others animals, too, when they hear danger lurking by.

Sagnarir hearing is extremely power, and impressing. It can hear things most creatures cannot, even the sophisticated with advanced technology. Even though many animals rely on the sagnarir, they tend to trust their predators, which doesn't give much time for the others around them; which results in the sagnarir standing upon its hind legs, taking a clearer look.

Sagnarir reproduce quite often, and the kits in their litter range from one to four kits. They mate almost any time of year, which is perfect is any pendragon wishes to adopt one of these delicate but fascinating creatures.
