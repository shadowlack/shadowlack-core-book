A poisonous snake that at adulthood reaches about 4ft (1.2m) in length. They are the same colour as desert sands, which makes them incredibly difficult to see. They have an arrow shaped head, and are normally seen curled in a ball, when provoked.

This in itself is very dangerous, because their bite is quite painful, and fatal, if not taken care of immediately. They bask in the sun at dawn and dusk, and are active then, when the sands are cooler. They hunt anything small that they can find, which is usually rodents and other small mammals.

If you stumble onto one, make slow movements away, anything done toward them or done quickly is perceived as a threat, and they will strike to bite. They are very hostile, and will chase you for a few feet to make sure you don't come back, but most of their aggressiveness is fear-driven. If you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone.
