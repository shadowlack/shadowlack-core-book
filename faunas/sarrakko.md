The **sarrakko** resembles, in size and appearance, the velociraptor of prehistoric Earth. They are, surprisingly, the size of a small dog. They are generally brown, almost tan, but grey or green ones are not uncommon. This species is easily recognized by their bipedal reptilian appearance, seemingly humanoid, clawed hands, and large, sickle-like toe claw on each foot. Sarrakkoes are among the most dangerous of predators, as they are intelligent and built to be swift killers.

These creatures hunt and live in packs, usually of up to fifteen. It's nearly impossible to tame an adult sarrakko, but if you raise one from the egg (which is very difficult to obtain as parents are extremely protective of their eggs and young), you'll have a strong, loyal ally. They live almost anywhere, but generally they leave pendragons alone - only in the harshest climates will there be a good chance of being attacked by a pack of them. Even so, wherever you go, be on your guard at night!
