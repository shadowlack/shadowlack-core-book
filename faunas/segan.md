A fishlike, reptilian creature that is able to live on ground and in the water. Gills flare out from the side of its head, and they are generally and vaguely large, perhaps around four feet in length. Scales cover their bodies, and during maturity, they go through a metamorphosis, growing lungs. They are not unlike snakes, and their eyes are almost glazed over, sporting a pair of extra, translucent eyelids. Their colour tends to range from blue to black, and anywhere in the spectrum between.

Segans are omnivorous, and will eat just about anything. Because of its size, it is nearly and always constantly eating. They are found in caves, and light will cause them to scuttle away at any beam, since their eyes are unable to handle direct light.
