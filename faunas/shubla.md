Shublas are large, slow and bulky. They aren't often seen, and aren't very friendly. Although they have no teeth, they can spontaneously bring up their body temperature, making them extremely hard to catch alive. Their skin is rough and they have long claws on their paws, ideal for digging. They feed on insects mainly, but can be found eating desert plants as well. They don't care much for each others' company, but are sometimes seen basking in groups. During most of the day and night they are resting in burrows. If approached, they make loud hissing sounds and even though they do not have teeth, they will still bite and can make nasty cuts with their claws.
