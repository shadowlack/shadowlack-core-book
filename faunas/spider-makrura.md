The makrura is a waterborne insectoid. They resemble terran lobsters, but they have large eyes and beaks resembling those of birds of prey.

The spider makrura is the same size as their Domestic cousins. They come in different shades of blue, and it's common that one of their pincers get notably bigger than the other.
