A highly poisonous snake-like animal that at adulthood reaches about 5ft (1.5m) in length. They are a light brown, or dark sand colour, with black markings along their back. They have an arrow shaped head, and the capability to fan out the upper part of their neck into a 'hood' when provoked.

These snakes are very dangerous, because you don't need to be near them to get bitten: they spit their neurotoxin venom from afar, and the adults can spit nearly as long as their bodies. When close enough to be bitten, their bite is very painful, and fatal, if not taken care of immediately. A fully grown pendragon will die within six hours of a bite.

They bask in the sun during the day, and are active then, when the sands are cooler. They hunt anything small that they can find, which is usually rodents and other small mammals.

If you stumble near where one in resting, they will hiss loudly to warn you away. They are very hostile, and will chase you to make sure you don't come back. They are incredibly intelligent. If you leave them alone, however, they'll leave you alone.
