The mythological **spyrax** is a spiked blue snake, 27 metres in length and 3 metres in girth, winding down to its heavy scaled tail. While its body resembles a snake, its head is more of a deranged gila monster, both menacing and sleek in design. On its upper half, the spyrax has two muscular arms with a hand that has five fingers, possibly a change in the evolutionary link that would have meant a far worse beast in the future.
