**Sreiitpte** is an extremely rare creature, lurking in the heart of Fronima. It is said to feast off the souls of the deceased, and the courageous state they are deadly creatures. With a closer look, their height ranges widely, and their weight depend on their height. But from recent information, they are cold, harsh, and cruel to all around them - including on another. They prefer torture as an amusement, some kind of sick entertainment; they are sly and cunning, and can outwit even the most intelligent pendragons.

The sreiitpte looks like a canine fused with a reptilian at a distance; it has thin, matted fur that ranges from murky green to black in colour, cold, pupil-less eyes that too range widely in colour, and a reptilian tail, coated in fur but tends to be spiked. They have triangular ears, which are pierced with a number of holes to represent a rank in their 'clans'. They shoulders are broad, and the males tend to be rather muscular, unlike the bony females.

The sreiitpte have the option to reproduce any time. The usually have one to two offspring in their litter, and they abandon them around the ages of three or four. But it is rather rare for sreiitpte to reproduce, for they are heartless and rarely show affection towards one another.

Beware, for they can outwit their prey and attack for the fun of it. But if you see two together, there's guaranteed a clan lurking near.
