A snake that at adulthood reaches about 6ft (1.8m) in length. It is a constrictor, which means while it has rear fangs, it is not poisonous. It prefers to kill by suffocating whatever it can catch. They are a moderate shade of green, with alternating light green, and dark green stripes. Young striped tmukas live higher up, feeding on birds, so they are generally brighter in colour than adults.

They are common in jungle areas, but due to their capability for quick movement; once they sense a vibration of something larger than they are capable of capturing and eating, they make a break for it, and will hide very quickly. If one approaches slowly, they will usually stay still to try and avoid capture.
If one captures a striped tmuka, they are capable of biting, and painfully with very big rear-jaw fangs, but they will likely try to constrict you to make you release them, and let them get away.
