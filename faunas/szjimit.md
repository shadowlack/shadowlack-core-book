**Szjimit** are perhaps the most irritating creatures ever on Ramath-lehi. About seven centimetres long, these garishly-coloured insects (ranging from blue to red to yellow) emit a high buzzing whine whenever they fly. They feed on sticky berries when there is nothing else around - most of the time their staple diet is blood, sucked from anything they land on.

If a szjimit bites something, it leaves a rash which itches for weeks, and because of chemicals released when it feeds, it can cause severe skin problems in those sensitive to it. Luckily, they only appear when the sun is highest, and then only in hotter months. The rest of the time, they hide under bark or beneath a few centimetres of loose soil. They lay their larvae in the ground in mid-Tria, the time when they thrive most. In Mia, every szjimit is killed by the cold, but in Dyo all the larvae hatch and emerge from beneath the ground, feeding on the case they were in.
