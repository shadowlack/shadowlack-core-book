The thorn lizard lives in the dunes Of the [Tmu Desert](/Tmu_Desert ""). It is for the most part, completely harmless. It only eats creatures smaller than itself. The thorn lizard can withstand burning temperatures, but when exposed to an open flame, it goes up quickly because of the flammable substance it sweats. The thorn lizard can be trained easily and they are good defenders while in swarms. They have razor sharp teeth and claws, and small dull spikes covering the lengths of their backs.
