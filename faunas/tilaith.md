Tilaiths are small snake-like aquatic creatures. They are very long and thin, most of them never growing to be more than the circumference of a pencil (though most females are noticeably thicker than males). While idly swimming, a tilaith can look like a worm or snake of some sort. They do in fact have two long fins protruding at either side of their long thin bodes. These fins have clear webbed spines or nails that help to propel them through the water. These spines are very sharp and provide excellent defense for the fish. Normally their tails are simply long extensions of their bodies with a small half fin at the tip. When need arises however, the fish can unsheathe a series of long clear webbed spines like those on their fins. The placement of these extra appendages depends on the gender of the fish. The spines of the female tilaith are lined up along their back and go down to their tail. The spines of males are longer and protrude out the back of their necks, creating two wings. For both genders, these webbed spines allow the fish to move much faster than normal. These fish can range in colour from black to a neon or sky blue. They can also appear in various shades of green. These fish strangely, have a small tuft of hollow fibre fur that grows normally out the right side of the head. The other side has a large ear-like appendage that sticks out from the head and functions as a set of gills. The brain of this creature is located towards the left side of the head (toward the gill) instead of the center. They are common salt water fish and provide a very tough and unsatisfying snack for larger predators.

These creatures, though small, are very hostile and will attack any intruder or offender no matter their size. They have large upper fangs and many other small teeth and will not hesitate to bite. Their spines are also very sharp, and their scales are rough and pointed as well. They are scavengers and will eat any food they can find.
