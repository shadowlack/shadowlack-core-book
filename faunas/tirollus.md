Tirollus are small grub-like creatures. They have very tiny legs covering their entire body. Their skin is a dull brown colour, and their legs look a bit like tiny hairs. Having so many legs allows them great mobility. They can move forward on their tiny legs, they can roll sideways, or they can move in any other odd direction they can manage. In contrast to their great movement abilities, they are very slow in speed. These are generally found under fallen trees or some other tight hiding place.

The tirollus will spend their whole life looking for food, storing food and eating. It is not unusual for a tirollus to die having a stash of food enough to last 3-5 lifetimes. A tirollus will only stop hunting food once toward the end of its life, when it reproduces. After mating, the male will return to his stash and stay until he dies, the female will give birth and care for the newborn until she passes.
