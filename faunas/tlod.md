Tlods are much like snakes, but they're usually much thicker and more grotesque than any normal serpent, with huge cranial cavities and enormous, protuberant eyes. In fact, they resemble Earth's slugs, only on a much grander scale. They hatch during the muggy days of Dyo, from a cluster of slime-slathered eggs, and come in a variety of colours and personalities; most are blandly toned, dull-witted, and mild-tempered, however. Of course, as with any species, there are exceptions - it is said that there are lean, brightly-coloured tlods out there, beautiful to behold, and strangely clever. These, of course, are rare, and can only be obtained via "special means", such as in trades in [Bhim](/countries/bhim)'s dark markets.
