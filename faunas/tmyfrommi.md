Tmyfrommis are extremely similar to Earth's rabbit, though bulkier, larger, more aggressive, and much more intelligent than Earthen lapins. They are incredibly quick learners, and can become especially adept in mathematics, literature, and the arts. In way of physical attributes, they usually possess plush ivory or smokey coats, with darker smudge markings on their appendages. Their eye colours range from vibrant violet to the most sickly of yellow hues, and usually reflect the creature's personality - the brighter and healthier the eyes, the more charismatic they are rumored to be. Tmyfrmmis are relatively rare and unduly enigmatic, but they are treasured for their wonderful abilities as familiars. Many pendragons take them as sidekicks or as friends because of their remarkable intelligence levels, though only the wealthiest or luckiest can obtain these rare jewels. You see - tmyfrommis are shrewd and independent creatures, and they are too intelligent to become simple "pets". They either have to be offered a hefty price (such as limitless jewels - their single greatest weakness is an affinity for all things that sparkle) to become one's familiar, or they must choose a particular pendragon to be their master; there is no other way to befriend one.
