A summoned ice beast, commonly created by a violent disturbance in the flow of Fronima. This beast is an ice elemental, draconic in appearance and ferocious. The totobenki stretches at its maximum length to thirty feet long, has two arms at five feet long, and is covered in horns of ice. It largely resembles a lizard, and finds refuge in icy seas near places that experience frequent death or waste of magic.

A totobenki usually dies within a week of forming from its magical source, becoming freed Fronima in the form of small, permanently frozen ice crystals. Only four or more crystals survive natural death or destruction, and can be used as a valuable fuel for machina. These creatures often kill living creatures in order to keep their own life source flowing.
