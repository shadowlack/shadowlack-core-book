Around the size of a terrier, trinthili live in heavily-inbred flocks of up to 40. In most areas, Trinthili live in the open (in hollows, or sheltered by bushes) but at times retire to a network of underground tunnels. However, in desert or polar climates, they spend much of their time underground, only emerging to mate or find food. A young Trinthil is born blind and furless (in litters of up to seven or in rare cases nine), and remains underground with its mother until it is ten months old, when its horns and have developed.

Trinthili have tawny brown fur, which is lighter on the underbelly, paws, and around the facial area. They have long and sensitive whiskers sprouting from wedge-shaped noses, and tails that go sharply upwards, then cascade downwards with fluff. Being digging animals, they have 7 large claws on each paw. Also to aid with their digging, three ribbed horns protrude from their forehead. They curve outwards in the manner of antelope's horns, and can be longer than half the length of the trinthil. Each Dyo they lose their horns, but by Tria they will have grown back larger. Despite their horns and claws, which could be formidable weapons, trinthili are only at all warlike when fighting over mates. Amazingly stupid, they will let a predator right next to them before they realize they should be running away.
