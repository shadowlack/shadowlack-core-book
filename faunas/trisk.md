The body is like that of a tiny hawk. Claws, feet, beak and eyes are all black while the body is thickly feathered in combinations of rich metallic colours. The birds that are kept in the wild are always solid coloured, though the captive kept animals have developed a wide range of colours.

## Behaviour

## Reproduction

When they nest, the father builds a nest of sticks, twigs and grasses to impress the female. The female will join the male she prefers in his nest and they will mate. About a week later, the female will lay her eggs and sit on them for about 2 weeks while the male keeps her supplied with food. They will hatch out at the end of the two weeks. The chicks grow for another 2 weeks before they are mature enough to begin their first molt (Which occurs over the course of a week) and leave the nest. For the first month after they leave they nest, they'll stay close to their parents, who will continue to help them learn to hunt.

## Social structure

## Diet

Trisk hunt on the wing, preferring the small hummingbird like birds called [flitter](/faunas/flitter). They will also hunt small rodents and similarly sized creatures when flitter are not available. 

## Cultural impact

### Domestication

These hawks are commonly kept as pets and are highly trainable. Falconers use them frequently for hunting tiny flitter for sport.
