At first, the **tucumu** may seem to be a small, insignificant creature, and yet another fish in the lakes. However, when one looks at them, it turns out to be a very different story.

They are most often seen swimming in the Magi Lake at sunset and sunrise, scouring for insects that live on the surface of the lake and devouring them. Biologists that have captured them for research have discovered an amazing amount about this species.

Tucumii are a dark grey, with lighter grey around their eyes and underbelly. They have dark spots near their dorsal fins on each side. Almost every fin they have is translucent, and seems to create a rainbow effect in them if the lighting angle is just right. A number of artists love to see this, and sketch this.

The tucumu is edible, and is often a popular meal in many dishes. However, if not carefully prepared, it can cause sickness - just like any meat.

Mating takes place early in the spring. The female is often larger, and males make up for this by having larger fins. Males compete for attention by showing off their fins. If the female complies, mating takes place. Female tucumii often lay hundreds of eggs, but only a fraction of these actually reach adulthood due to aquatic predators.
