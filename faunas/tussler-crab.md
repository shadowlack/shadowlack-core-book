The tussler crab is a squat-like creature that has two separately living sides. One side is the dominant one and grows bigger than the other, and after about halfway through their life, the two, (or the two count as one) Split apart and the older one goes about it's life without having to deal with the second side. The second head starts growing a smaller newer side, and it is the only documented way of reproducing. The tussler crab is not a threat to anything twice it's size, as it will avoid anything that big. But as for smaller creatures, it will scamper after them sideways reaching incredible speeds, until they catch up and rip the victim apart with their claws. Tussler crabs live solitary lives, except for the first part of their life attached to the other half, and are cannibals to other crabs besides their other side. They hunt on land for short periods of time and then retreat to shallow water. Although they are usually frightened of larger creatures, when cornered, they will attack the threat with their claws. No fatalities have been recorded from tussler crabs to date.
