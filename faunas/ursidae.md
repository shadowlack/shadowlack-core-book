A large creature, similar in features to a polar bear. Its thick fur appears white, but is truly hollow and transparent, this allows light to refract inside the hair and warm to body the truly black-skinned predator. Their nose, claws, and eyes are all black. They are huge creatures, being 8 or 9ft (2.4 or 2.7m) at the shoulder when on all fours, and roughly twice that height when standing upright.

They are perfectly comfortable at all times on the year on the ever-frigid continents, and in those places, they are the supreme predator. They are hardly ever seen off [Dhruv](/countries/dhruv) or [Trilok](/countries/trilok). They are very good swimmers, and have no fear of the icy waters.

Arctic ursidae hunt whenever they feel the need, and hunt whatever is available. They aren't afraid of anything, including pendragons, and will most easily chase down any pendragon they can catch, along with any other prey they may find.

Only the females of this species hibernate, and only for a few months, which during that time, two or three cubs will be born. She stays hidden in a little self-made cave of ice and snow, where she keeps the cubs warm until they're old and big enough to keep out the cold of the continent they live on. Otherwise, they roam throughout the year.
