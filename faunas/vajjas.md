They are like ferrets but they are completely black. They live in trees and are very quick, sly, stealthy and observant. They have tails that vary from vajjas to vajjas, most common being furrles with a tuft of fur at the end. They speak some English that they have picked up from travelers but prefer to not speak at all. If you have anything of worth they will try to steal it from you just for fun.
