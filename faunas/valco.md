The **valco** appears much like an eel. It's body is very long, often seven feet in an adult of either gender. This species of fish is often covered in stripes or dots that are pure black. Against their often neon scale colours.

Valci have four fins, often translucent the shimmer the same colour as their scales. Males have frills at the base of their skulls that cover their gills along with a large ridge down their back. These are the same as their fins. Females lack the frills and their ridges are smaller than the males.

Their heads are long and their jaws are huge and full of needle like teeth that help them eat their main source of food. Seabirds. Valci have two ways of catching the seabirds.

The first way is that when the birds are sitting on the water after eating the valco will sneak up under it and grab its feet in its jaws and drag it under, holding it there until it drowns.

The second way, is that it sticks its head out of the water. It then spits a substance (It has not been proven if it's a type of acid or even fire.) that burns the bird's feathers. Often throwing the bird off and causing it to plummet, or wound the bird so much that it must land in the water. These fish will stalk the birds until they are within the range to be attacked and eaten.

Mating season often takes place in early Tria and lasts all month. The male will show off for the females in an elaborate show. Sometimes two males will duke it out over a female, a hissing, showing off battle. Often neither will get hurt. Except for maybe pride gashing.

After a male and female pair get together they will mate. After 1 month the female will lay 2-3 eggs that she will guard until they hatch. Once they hatch the female will go back to a normal life pattern until next mating season.
