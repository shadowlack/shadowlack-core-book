Vuna are almost like small dragons, long neck, head shape similar to the bearded dragon's. It has no arms or hands. It has short legs and feet with retractable claws. They are social creatures, if you happen to find one, there is often more near. They come in a small variety of colours, blue, brown, copper, green and gold.

Gold vuna are always female and are referred to, not as a gold vuna, but Queen, as the group is usually led by a vuna of this colour and is the only one capable of laying eggs. It is very difficult to tame a wild vuna, and it is a wiser choice to hatch an egg instead.
