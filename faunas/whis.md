A **whis** is a tiny, tiny creature, it's body 5 millimetres long at most. It is entirely made of a white, translucent fibrous material. Coming from every surface its minuscule body are many legs, resembling thin threads of wool or fluffy cotton. Overall, by day whis look like puffballs or thistledown. However, by night, they glow. Depending on what it has eaten that day, the colour changes. They feed on berries by landing on them and drawing juice from them with a few of their legs. Their legs are only sharp when they are feeding, otherwise they are very soft. They only have the smallest of brains, and the rest of their body is heart and stomach.

## Reproduction

A whis has a life span of only a few days, but they mature and breed very fast, and if they were not prey to so many things there would be too many of them, and they would be denounced a pest.

## Cultural impact

Whis have been credited with both luring travellers to their doom, and leading them away from danger. Both of these are fabrications, as they do not have the mental capacity.

- Whis are a major ingredient in the manufacturing of [Paupfaedhs](/technologies/paupfaedhs).
