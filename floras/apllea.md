A round juicy fruit bearing many tastes depending on the area and strain of apella. The most common is the *gradre* (pronounced grahh-dreh) - a play on words instead of naming it directly after the [Grader](/genealogy/grader) family. Its skin is a light green with a dusky blue hue. The crisp fruit is a powdery blue and with the other strains of apllea that exist its fruit is a greenish white on the inside and a variety of greens, reds, and oranges on the skin.

In the Tessera season the trees (8 to 9 ft tall and about 4m wide) blossom the gradre having dusky purple flowers and the other varieties white and/or pink. However the gradre is not able to cross pollinate with any other strain of apella.
