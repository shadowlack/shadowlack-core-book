A fast-growing bamboo-like plant, though unlike bamboo its stem isn't hollow. The bokbu is a fairly common snack; *bokbu sticks* are basically fully-grown bokbu plants with the leaves stripped off and added flavouring. It is usually commercially grown, though it's also possible for one to grow their own bokbu.
