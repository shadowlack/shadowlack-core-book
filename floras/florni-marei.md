Though not edible raw, alchemists and people good with medicines use this herb for medical purposes.

The Florni Marei is a special herb due to the fact that it never completely dies off. Only the flowers die. This is why alchemists and doctors attempt to get these flowers between the day they blossom and the day they die off. They blossom on the first day of the Dyo quarter then, die off on the 20th day of the Dyo quarter, so they only stay abloom for a maximum of 20 days.

Florni Marei are mainly a green color but some are a light orange colour and always have hot pink flowers. The flowers are similar to tulip heads, but are 3/4 the normal height and 1/2 the normal width. The leaves are broad and are 9 cm long and always remain a vibrant green colour. Same with the stalks, but some can be a light orange colour, which are very rare.

They are used to make sleeping pills as a help to go to sleep and sleeping powder for escaping your foes by putting them to sleep because of the pollen they contains. The leaves are used for antidotes and anti-venoms if bitten by or ingested something poisonous. The roots go 15 cm into the ground and are used as a antiseptic that is helpful for burns when crushed. Found in cave entrances, grassland fields, and at the base of forest tree trunks.
