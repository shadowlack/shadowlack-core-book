One reported in existance.

Found where none would ever think of venturing to - the middle of the desert, per say - it's said to have been planted by a visiting Rapine at some point in time. It's roots extend to the middle of the earth, where it feeds on the metallic ball of lava. The flora's preferred meal is the soul of a living thing, much like it's creator's. 

## Magical properties

Not much is known about this plant, including its true form. To the extent of our knowledge, it has no stable appearance. It morphs into what you wish for most at that moment, eg. water, food, etc.. The happiest being on the planet would be unharmed by it. It's use isn't known, and one could only guess it would be planted to continue the Rapine's vile doings.
