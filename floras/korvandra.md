The **korvandra** is a sentient carnivorous plant. It's an offshoot of a similar plant called the vandra; a commonly held theory is that the korvandra developed after too many vandra plants absorbed too much Fromina.

As far as appearance, korvandras bear a vague resemblance to Earth's venus flytraps: from a central stem, their leaves end in either a pair of jaws, or flowers. At the top of the stem is the plant's "main jaw", and unlike its other jaws, this is a full-on eyeless head. The top jaw is flat, but the bottom jaw has a pouch which contains digestive chemicals. Despite being blind and deaf, it has very keen senses of taste, smell and touch.

Most of the plant's jaws can only eat tiny invertebrates, but the head is large enough to eat small animals. As such, owners of these plants are advised to keep pets and small children away from them.

And speaking of owners, a number of Pendragons keep korvandras as pets. Most of the interaction between plant and owner is through touch and smell. They usually respond positively to being gently stroked on the head; this is often used to show affection or to signal that they are about to be fed.
