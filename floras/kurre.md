The kurre is a herbaceous and biennial (meaning it takes about two years for it to complete its life cycle) plant with leaves forming a characteristic compact cluster at the centre (the head, which is eaten) around which the partially unfolded outer leaves are spread. The dense core at the centre of the leafy head is not eaten commonly. It is a dark green colour when healthy.

Broadly speaking, kurre varieties come in two groups - early and late. The early varieties mature in about 45 days. They produce small heads which do not keep well and are intended for consumption while fresh. The late kurre matures in about 87 days, and produces a larger head.

Control of insect pests is important, particularly in commercial production where appearance is a driver of success.

The kurre favours acidic soil in areas with readily available sunlight and water, and is generally a hardy plant
