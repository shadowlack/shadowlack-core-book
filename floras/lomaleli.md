The **lomaleli** is not as rare as one would be led to believe, just really hard to see. They resemble the terran rose, but is as white as the moon, thus the meaning of it's name. Another reason for it's name, translated from Lunelily (And again from Moonlily), blooms in the pale glow of the moon, and widens to show it's exquisite beauty. The four petals that encase the bud before it blooms, immediately dry up a wither away into tendrils that flow in the arctic wind, but do not separate from the flower. Once the sun rises, however, the flower will then wither and die, sending its dandelion-like spores into the air and to be lost in the vast wasteland.

Eating the Lomaleli breaches the boundaries of stupidity. It contains a very lethal poison that slowly kills the consumer over a course of a week. The symptoms of the poisoning include moments of lightheaded-ness and a numb feeling in the limbs. Ironically, the antidote for the poison, which will neutralize the poison as soon as it enters the bloodstream, is the withered petals that hang on the base of the bud. Eating the flower, even without the knowledge of the poison, is highly unfavorable, as it's sweet smell hide it's bitter taste.
