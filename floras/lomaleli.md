The **lomaleli** (also known as *lunelily* and *moonlily*) is not as rare as one would be led to believe, just really hard to see. They resemble the terran rose, but is as white as the moon, thus the meaning of its name. 

Lomaleli bloom in the pale glow of the moons, and widens to show their exquisite beauty. The four petals that encase the bud before it blooms, immediately dry up a wither away into tendrils that flow in the arctic wind, but do not separate from the flower. Once the sun rises, the flower will wither and die, sending fluffy florets into the air to be blown over the vast wasteland.

## Edible parts and uses

The lomaleli is classified as an [illegal substance](/culture/laws) on Ramath-lehi because of its lethality.

Voluntarily eating the lomaleli breaches the boundaries of stupidity. It contains a very lethal poison that slowly kills the consumer over a course of a week. The symptoms of the poisoning include moments of lightheaded-ness and a numb feeling in the limbs.

Ironically, the antidote for the poison, which will neutralize the poison as soon as it enters the bloodstream, is the withered petals that hang on the base of the bud. Eating the flower, even without the knowledge of the poison, is highly unfavorable, as its sweet smell hide its bitter taste.
