A medium sized tree, growing just about anywhere, but fruit production requires the climate to have at least a frost a minimum of once a year.

The fully grown tree has thick branches for the top two thirds of it's chocolate brown trunk. The lower branches are almost perpendicular to it's trunk, with the ends slowly curving toward the sky. Higher branches are more straight upward, giving the tree an overall umbrella feel to it. The leaves are as wide as a pendragon's hand, and are rather huge light green teardrops, with dark green undersides.

Onye Fruit
----------

The fruit is produced once a year, and can be harvested at the end of Tria. The fruit of a fully grown tree is about 6 inches (.15m) in diameter (smaller trees, of course, yielding smaller fruit) and the skin of the fruit is a bright red. The innards of the fruit are normally a very pale yellow. The seeds are found concentrated at the very center, where approximately ten teardrop shaped black seeds cluster together (those are not recommended edible).

Depending on the type of year and frost the tree had will determine the taste of the fruit; the fruit should be somewhat sweet, and juicy. Bitterness, over-sweetness, or dryness can be blamed on not long enough a winter, or not enough nutrients to the particular tree. (Younger trees normally have more of a problem with bad fruit than older trees.)
