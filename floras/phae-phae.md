The plant itself is short, and usually has very little leafage. Its stalk is a dark red, with its leafage a dull green. The leaves are long skinny spades, and are usually eaten up by insects. Above the ground, these plants are not very attractive at all, much do to the areas they are found. Below the ground, however rest large beautiful roots. The roots, known as "Phaetins" can be either bright red or bright green. They're shaped much like the leaves. Pointed at one end, wide at the opposite.
