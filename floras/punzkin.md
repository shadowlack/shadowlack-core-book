Origin unknown, The Punzkin is a variant of the thick skin fruits that have finally withered away in the harsher climates. Though this is not general knowledge - it is definitely blossoming in the warmer Ramathian soils after careful cross-pollination back many, many centuries ago. Varies generally, about 40cm wide and 30cm tall - smaller and bigger varieties not uncommon

Not commonly found growing wildly, the Punzkin grows best under farmer care in warm and wet conditions. Harvests are contained in specially formulated greenhouses that irrigate and keep temperature for optimum conditions in which they grow. Over time their original appearance has evolved.

From the ground a dark purple - almost black - vine sprouts from the ground in a twisting coil of leafy fronds until the flowering season has passed (Tria). These bright red, seven petal flowers give way to begin the bright blue nodule that later becomes the Punzkin.

In the early stages, the Punzkin keeps this electric blue hue, and after its initial growth period of three to four weeks it fattens out turning the bright neon orange which is associated with it in general. Because of these two transitions, in markets you can buy the huge orange versions, and the early smaller blue versions - both of which are suitable for cooking and carving.

Once the mushy pulp has been excavated, it begins to react with oxygen in the air, the carved skin will begin to glow with a neon quality often found in the clubs of Ramath-lehi. The colours range from a cool electric blue, into orange and yellow shades and finally menacing red hues. Speculation suggests that the longer the Punzkin is left on the vine before harvesting, the more brilliant it will glow, The length of time it retains its luminescence varies, the shortest time recorded is 3 days while the longest is a full 17 days. Generally the glow will remain bright and unwavering for the full week of festivities and tapers off until the glow diminishes. Therefore external light sources are unneeded.

However, it is not possible to predetermine the colours before they go out in the market - due to huge demands - Though there usually is small blotchy marking on the underside that may state the colour, In fact 3 out of 4 Punzkins glow the same colour indicated on the underside of the fruit.

Before the glowing process initiates, the innards of the Punzkin are an icy blue, and sometimes white in younger plants - often the pulp is used in soups, making a tangy warming broth, while the seeds are delicious toasted or in a form for baking eg. bread, cakes.

The Punzkin is often related to the Ramathian holiday - [Tumhuem](/Tumhuem "wikilink") - Its outer skin carved with faces of horror as a festive decoration at parties, even the upper classes can't resist a Punzkin at the windows.

Punzkins may be found anywhere with the right growing conditions, though they are found wild in predominately temperate forests.
