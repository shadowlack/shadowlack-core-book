The broad milky white leaves of this herb are similar in shape to the earthen lettuce, they are thick and rubbery to the touch but in its' raw unprocessed format it is nothing more than a shrub, in its shrub format it would literally look like a giant white lettuce.

To begin processing the plant for use you break the thick leaves of the Rizu, from this a lilac fluid begins to collect on the wound. This fluid is used to numb flesh and deadens the nerves making it an effective painkiller. Pill forms of this cream are used for nerve pains like headaches or general ailments like upset stomachs, toothache etc.

For industrial use the broken leaves are boiled until they become thin and wrinkled. These white, flexible and slightly transparent remains are used for natural bandages they decompose and dissolve into the skin after a week or more of wearing, it is believed that the natural salt in the skin causes the chemical breakdown. Once the boiled mixture cools, it leaves a thick lilac creamy residue which can be scented to cover the clinical smell. Like a fine wine, the longer it is kept the more immediate the numbing effects are. Rizu cream that is 20 years or older can deaden feeling in the bones, nerves and any surrounding tissues within the first 5 minutes of application. If the cream is dried under a Ultraviolet light it can be mixed with various other chemicals to make pills and powder capsules that are used for everyday pains.

These pills turn a bright purple when mixed with anything other than water therefore when bought over the counter they are a bright purple, any other colour suggests a bad pill batch or an unknown chemical in the mix. There are Pendragons who try to collect these off colour pills as they are rumoured to hold a strong narcotic. It is subject to rumour and no cases have been recorded to support this.

Ingesting the cream orally is not recommended as it can inhibit breathing and suffocate the swallower. Keep out of reach of small children.

As long as there is moisture and light it'll grow. Biggest yields are found in the temperate and tropical forests. It can grow in icy conditions though the plant will be smaller and tough, it is also more potent .
