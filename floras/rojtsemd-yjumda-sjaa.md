The **Bursting Orange Tree** has a squat, thick, and very dark trunk, which is home to just as many sprouts as the limbs are. The sprouts bloom in mid-Tria, and by the end of this quarter, the entire tree, from roots to apex, is covered in melon-sized, citrus-colored fruits. These fruits are often plucked from the tree to be eaten, but it is best to wait for them to ripen and fall to the ground. Then, they are the sweetest and most delicious. They are a candy-like treat to any fruit lover. These fruits, called yjumdas, are often harvested in great quantities, due to their delectable flavor and their rich concentration of vitamins.
