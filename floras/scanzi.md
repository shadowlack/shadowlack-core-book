Scanzi is an annoying weed that pops up at the worst of times. It grows in tufts of green grass-like leaves (seven to eight inches tall) and expands its roots underground killing anything else by stealing water. It blooms with large yellow or orange flowers and produces many seeds much like an Earth's dandelion.

It is munched on by some fauna but no sane pendragon would want to eat it.
