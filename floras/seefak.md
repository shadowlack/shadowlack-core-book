A very delicate looking plant that sways gently on the rocky reefs of the ocean. It thrives worldwide in its watery habitat and provides a home for small fish to escape predators.

It is a mix of light blues, purples and aquas and the leaves are long and smooth in appearance. They have been selectively bred in labs to produce a smaller domestic version for fish tanks as it filters the water while it produces oxygen in the large bubble at the end of each root.

When a single leaf is plucked from the plant it begins to take on a darker blue colour and the edges begin to turn a semi-transparent aqua. These single fronds are then dried onshore and are a delicious accompanment to raw or boiled fish. The Seefak can be cut into fine strips and weaved together to make a small edible circular bag which is filled with a variety of flavoured rices, spiced meats and fruits. These are popular appetizers and are no bigger than an eyeball.

The palm-sized bubbles at the bottom of the frond can be filled with a savoury fish paste and then fried for a seasoned sesame like flavour. The odor as it fries is mouth-watering, though because of the delicate nature of this bubble it is hard to master presentation; If fried too quickly the contents can bubble and burst the casing causing the contents to ooze out or explode in the oil. The only hole in the bubble is the small one poked into it to pipe the fish paste. As the fish paste fries, the mixture solidifies slightly stopping it from oozing out and making a general mess.
