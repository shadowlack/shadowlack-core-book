The uninteresting plant known as "skrud" grows anywhere it can on rocks in the cooler regions of the world. Its boring grey-green colour is monochromatic and a rock that it has grown on will have the appearance of being painted. A plant such as this may seem to be pointless - however, skrud is literally a lifesaver for a traveler in need. If you are lost in the mountains or simply have no food, just give a rock with skrud on it (aka a "skruddy" rock) a good scratching with your claws to remove the plant.

The powdery bits that scrape away are incredibly nutritious and have been known to save many a pendragon from sure death. Many also say that popping a small, skruddy rock into one's mouth and sucking on it can have healing properties, although this is debated.
