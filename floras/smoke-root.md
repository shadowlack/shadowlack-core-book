Smoke Roots are not typically roots, but their roots are a key factor. The leaves themselves smoke, the scent is repulsive to many. They are grey and rather dull. They can grow up to six feet around. When the Smoke Root does flower it produces many small white blossoms that bloom and die within a week. The root itself is scorching to the touch, and must be handled with gloves. After an hour of being pulled from the ground it loses most of the heat and is safe to touch with bare hands. This is the part most often used in foods, but the leaves are edible as well. The flowers can also be eaten like broccoli, but are not as commonly used.

Smoke Root only grows in desolate areas or humid places. Often in mountains or caves, due to the fact that nothing really attempts to eat it there, and it can grow large in peace. Or in wetlands and swamps, they are more commonly found in these areas but are much smaller.
