A squeet is a huge floating pad of plant matter that is found only on swamp surfaces. It is grayish in color, and it generally appears unsavory. But once it is sliced open, delicious, thin milk pours out. The milk is very nourishing, and it replenishes energy quickly. It's sweet and high in calcium. The peel generally has no nutritional value, though it is sometimes devoured for its slightly tangy, swampy flavor. Squeets can also be used as floats on which to sunbathe for smaller Ramathians.
