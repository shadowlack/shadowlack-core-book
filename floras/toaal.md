One of Ramath-lehi's more common types of grasses. Toaal are a typical source of food for herbivorous grassland dwellers. An offshoot of the species is also often used as turf for lawns. Interestingly, this plant is susceptible to absorbing Fromina in small amounts, though it does little more than change the colour of individual grasses. Usually to blue, for some reason.
