A pretty and slender looking aquatic flower with a long neck and an expanded bulb like base (50 to 60cm high and 15 to 25 cm wide). Dark grey roots cling onto rock surfaces where it is found â€” It cannot take hold in the sandy ocean bottom due to the fineness of its roots - And allow it to stay affixed even in strong underwater currents. It is known to be a carnivorous plant that lures small to medium sized fish in its grasp with its unusual colours and worm-like lures.

The flower itself is mainly pink with dashes of peach throughout though it can tint towards light yellow sometimes. The ends are flexible and move freely and enticingly like worms for hungry prey. Passing fish will swim towards the plant and bite one of these pink, worm-like lures. The fish is then glued to the plant and unable to escape. the flower folds in on itself once it lands a 'bite' further trapping the fish. Corrosive acid breaks the fish down and it dies a slow painful death, only when the fish has been "digested" will the flower open once more and start its cycle over again.
