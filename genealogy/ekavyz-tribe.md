## About

All about the Ekavyz Tribe. Patrons of Penn. 

### Defining Characteristics

- The Ekavyz tribe carry the genetic markers for shorter, oilier coats that mark them as fishers and sailors. They have two permanent settlements: **Augri**, a major shipping hub to the other continents and one of the few industrialized cities in Dhruv, and **Mijjroi**, a town sprung up around the industry brought in from foreign 'dragons. Mijjroi caters primarily to eco tourism and both public and private expeditions further into the continent.
