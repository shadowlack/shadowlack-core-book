## About

Known as the **Mahji-Grader** family in official documentation and **Grader** in the local vernacular. The Graders are an ancient and noble bloodline. Their lineage may be traced back hundreds of centuries. They have always been a very prolific family in regards to both planetary political matters and all things relating to Fronima, and have been the ruling royal family of Ramath-lehi on numerous occasions.

Many formidable mages have belonged to the Grader family, and their natural ties to Fronima are undeniably strong. Their Fronima advancements are unparalleled by any other Ramathian family. The Graders are often credited for having "tamed" Fronima and channelling it into the widely popular and useable form of magicka.
