## History

Bhim wasn’t always the grey battle ground it was today. Like the other continents it went through its share of power holders before being recognized into the planets united governing force.

Bhim’s environment was once a much more forgiving place. It was actually due to a large amount of natural resources and riches that many ‘dragons made their home there. Every new patch of gold led to a group being started claiming it for their own. They would organize around it, fight for it, and pay for it with their lives. The ‘dragons of the country quickly became divided and fraction by the promise of wealth and comfort. Groups became tribes, tribes elected leaders, and leaders went to war. Thousands of years later a few key tribes remained, each making a play for a united continent, believing their way to be the best.

While many of the warring tribes got smaller, some were able to survive by backing out of power struggles and focusing on riches instead. However one tribe, the Janhyul, quickly filled the now vacant positions and were able to establish themselves as the driving force of uniting Bhim under one rule.

Most theorize that the Janhyul only made it into the Council of Twelve by act of luck. They were at their peak power when the Council was founded and the most logical representative of the continent. They had ancient enough bloodlines and magical talents to rival the other royal families of the time. even if they never used them in the most conventional manner. They specialized in deceit and illusions, protections and barriers, which only served to cause suspicion to trail them as forcefully as a shadow. It was thanks to these skills that the family was able to withstand the years of infighting that happened amongst tribes. And also how they were able to escape their eventual defeat.

But the ‘dragons of Bhim didn’t appreciate being ruled by self-proclaimed royalty, it wasn’t in their nature to accept laws from a higher power. As the population become more restless the ruling family became more totalitarian. New laws were enacted nearly every day but there were few 'dragons left to enforce them. Tensions on both sides continue to rise and the economy and infrastructure of the country started to crumble. The rule of the Janhyul only lasted a few centuries, it was long enough to break down ancient tribal rivalries, but not long enough to tame the independent Bhimite spirit. The country, while suffering through some of it's darkest days after the Janhyul rule, adapted to their new found lawlessness rather quickly as it was the only way to survive a failed economy.

The Janhyul were forcefully and brutally ejected by the Bhimites, but not completely defeated. Saved only by the grace of their magical protections. Having spent the years watching from the side lines, some members of the Council had offered to help the family out privately but each instance was refused. As the Janhyul's finally started to loose a grip on their country the rest of the Council made a public statement offering aide to the territory. Taking offense at the offer and it's political maneuvering to make the Council look good, the Janhyul's refused once again and withdrew themselves from the table. They re-established themselves as a crime organization, using what wealth and influence they had left. Bitter at their own defeat, they worked hard to thwart any other groups rise to dominance. In modern day Bhim it’s said that the Janhyul line still survives in a few, but their methods have changed. Along with any of the other surviving powerful families, their children are only princes to thieves. They continue to fight over small offenses, while trying to run the country from the shadows, but none wanting to earn too much attention.

### Influence and influences

While the acts of the Janhyul may someday be forgotten, their legacy lives on in the pockets of every Bhimite. The Bhim currency, the Bhijan, brought into practice by Janhyuls first head of household, takes its name from the combination of the ruling family and the country they ravaged.​
