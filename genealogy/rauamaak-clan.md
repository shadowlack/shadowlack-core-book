## About

### Defining Characteristics

- Possibly one of the least reclusive Fey clans out there; the clan actively mingles with non-Fey, and some members are at least acquainted with some of Ajita's politicians.
- Keeping with the insect-like theme of the Alanamsul, the Rauamaak usually bear a slight resemblance to moths.
