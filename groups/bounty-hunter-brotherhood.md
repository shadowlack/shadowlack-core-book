## Purpose

The **Bounty Hunter Brotherhood** (also called *Ryomsi Homsaj Rjyshajhyyp* in Ramathian) is a guild for Assassins and Bounty Hunters. It is the oldest surviving example of such a guild, and as of 81,387 it is currently the largest, with almost 3,000 known members worldwide. 

To provide a collective and code of ethics for those in the bounty hunter and assassination industry. Those belonging to the Bounty Hunter Brotherhood are more likely to be picked for missions versus independent contractors.

## Locations

The organisation is based in [Swaraj](/countries/swaraj), though there are branches in some other countries as well.

## Hierarchy

## Members

All members must follow the [Code of the Bounty Hunter](/creeds/code-of-the-bounty-hunter), or face wrathful consequences. It is their strict adherence to the Code that makes them so ruputable.
