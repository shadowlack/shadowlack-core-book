Before the [Council of Thirteen](/groups/council-of-thirteen), Zamfir and Karryasa Grader maintained a **Council of Twelve**. It has long since been a Ramathian custom to have a Council of advisors. The Councilpersons all drew from different fields of work and were said to be relied upon to give their views and update the Graders on the current status of their specified areas.

## Purpose

To govern the planet of Ramath-lehi.

## Locations

## Hierarchy

Karryasa and Zamfir Grader were the leaders of the Council of Twelve.

The Council of Twelve was first formed by twelve leaders originating from twelve different competing tribes. Council positions, since the beginning, have usually been passed on through blood ties and have been hereditary. It has not been unknown for the leaders in power to suddenly remove or kick out a current council member and appoint someone else in their place or for someone to actually be voted into a council position. Council Meetings were held on the 2nd of every quarter within the secure walls of the Council Chamber on Ajita.

## History

Unfortunately, the Council of Twelve wasn't very effective. To the general public, they appeared to be a formidable force, providing Zamfir and Karryasa with much needed input. The Twelve were in fact merely figureheads, put in place by Graders in order to make it seem as if they were listening to the public's cries. Although both Zamfir and Karryasa's hearts were both in the right places, it can be said that sometimes their hands and heads were quite in the wrong. So what about the Graders?

No doubt you have already come across the Graders name on the web site before. The Graders are the former dictators of Ramath-lehi. Karryasa Jolten-Grader was the Arch Magosai. She was a very adept telepath with increasing ties to Fronima. Zamfir Grader was the Arch Magos. His strength lies in magic which uses Fronima as its source of power. The Graders came into power the Ramathian year of 81344. Their reign finally came to an end on Mia 22, 81380.

The common belief was that Zamfir Grader existed as a mere shadow puppet that Karryasa acted through and used to her advantage. Karryasa, being somewhat physically disabled, but extremely mentally capable, could easily use Zamfir and persuade him to do her bidding. Not much was known about their true relationship, other than the fact that they are mates and had eleven children over the span of their long marriage.

Despite misgivings, the Graders were actually quite fair and capable leaders. Their views pulled largely from a modified idea of communism. Communism, in its purist form is where everyone is working for everyone else. So what about the Dragyns?

The Arch Magos and Magosai before Zamfir and Karryasa Grader were Sari and Thanos Dragyn. They were the victims of an unfortunate machina explosion that cost them their lives and put an abrupt end to their political reign. The Graders, having assisted the Dragyns throughout their reign (though some may say resentfully), quickly swept into power after their deaths and restored order to the distressed public.

Rumour has it that the late Sari Dragyn used to haunt Karryasa Grader's dreams.

The massive Dragyn family clan is now more so renown for their involvement in the Space Exploration and Colonization programme.
