The **Uajeul Suksekul Russuleym** (USR) is Ramath-lehi's largest military operation.

## Purpose

To protect Ramath-lehi from aliens and outside threats. To maintain the [PRIMUS](/technologies/primus) database of knowledge.

## Locations

The USR's primary headquarters are in Tarkus on [Ajita](/countries/ajita). It has outposts in every country and multiple outposts that are off-planet, such as Sector 04 of the [Therscatran Gate](/countries/therscatran-gate).

## Hierarchy

It is composed of four specialized divisions:

1. [Tguka](/groups/military-tguka) (Space warfare)
2. [Mubi](/groups/military-mubi) (Navy)
3. [Nujemat](/groups/military-nujemat) (Ground soldiers)
4. [Tamsemalt](/groups/military-tamsemalt) (Sentinels)

Each of these divisions are divided into hierarchical ranks that eventually report all the way up to the Togjana Nelesuji Damajul, who sits on the [Council of Thirteen](/groups/council-of-thirteen) as the Councillor of Military and Weaponry. Despite there being four divisions, there is much overlap within the USR as the divisions actively collaborate on assignments with one another. The approximate percentage of active recruits per division is as follows: Tguka (45%), Mubi (17%), Nujemat (30%), and Tamsemalt (8%).
