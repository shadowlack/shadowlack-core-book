There is very little official information about this occult group, most of what reaches the media is rumor and speculation. The bulk of information is gathered from family and friends of 'dragons who have join in with the cult; leading to a very biased view projected by most of the population.

## Purpose

### Activities

The biggest practice of the group is know as *Entering the Dreamscape*, details are unclear but what is known so far is that the members take a sleeping aide, then the master Dream Weavers of the group intertwine the minds of the group into a large Dream Bubble where the participants can live out magical and half real experiences. The fear behind this kind of activity is that 'dragons may become seduced by the dream world and become depressed and distracted when trying to resume living in real life.

### Beliefs

*To be determined.*
