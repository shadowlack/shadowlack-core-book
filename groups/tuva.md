## Purpose

To protect and ensure the safety and well-being of all Ramathians. Tuva employs extremely talented mages who have strengths in magic-suppression, as well as individuals who are extremely empathetic. All members have training in conflict resolution.

Tuva are most often called when there is a mental health crisis to be dealt with, or when there is a disaster that may be aided by magic (fire, flood, evil spirits and auras, rogue magic, etc). Given the strength of individual magic users on Ramath-lehi, the Tuva are very capable with magic themselves.

In extreme cases, they will use [Jolacom](/natural-resources/jolacom) to enhance their magic suppression abilities.

The Tuva are not arbiters of law and justice.

## Locations

There are Tuva outposts everywhere on Ramath-lehi, as well as some outposts that may be found off-planet.

## Hierarchy

Tuva report to the [Council of Thirteen](/groups/council-of-thirteen)'s *Councillor of Health*, *Councillor of Sociology*, and *Councillor of Thaumaturgy*. Each of the three is responsible for their respective expertise within Tuva.

## Members

All magic-using members of Tuva are members of the [Ramathian Mages Union](/groups/ramathian-mages-union).
