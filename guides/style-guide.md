## Capitalization

- All [species](/species) names should be capitalized. Eg. Pendragon, Lukuo, Yki, etc.
- Names of floras and creatures *should not* be capitalized unless they are at the beginning of a sentence.

## Italics

### Emphasis

Italics are used for emphasis, rather than boldface or capitals. But overuse diminishes its effect; consider rewriting instead.

### Foreign words

Use italics for phrases in other languages (Ramathian, Ykili, etc.) and for isolated foreign words that are not common in everyday English.

### Scientific names

Use italics for the scientific names of floras, animals, and all other organisms.

## Units of Measurement

All units of measurement should be provided using the Metric system.

## Earth Similies

Please do not reference Earth (Terran) events or Humans when contributing to the wiki. Earth does not exist in our game. You should avoid writing descriptors such as:

- "similar to an Earth crocodile"
- "fox-like"
- "like Harry Potter"

## Accepted Abbreviations

- The proper abbreviation of [Pendragon](/species/pendragon) is *'dragon* (with the leading apostrophe).
- The proper abbreviation of [Feydragon](/species/feydragon) is *Fey*.

## Media Files

### Images

Images uploaded should be in **.png** format.

## Spelling

A quick spellcheck before saving your edit is greatly appreciated.

### British/Canadian or American Spelling?

Either spelling is *correct*, so do not unnecessarily edit articles to change the spelling. However, as Shadowlack is based out of Canada, the default spelling is **Canadian English**.
