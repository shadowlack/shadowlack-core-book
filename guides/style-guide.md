## Capitalization

- All [species](/species) names should be capitalized. Eg. Pendragon, Lukuo, Yki, etc.
- Names of floras and creatures *should not* be capitalized unless they are at the beginning of a sentence.

## Boldface

Use boldface (**text like this**) to highlight the first occurrence of the title word/phrase of the article in the lead section.

## Italics

### Emphasis

Italics are used for emphasis, rather than boldface or capitals. But overuse diminishes its effect; consider rewriting instead.

### Italicize names and titles 

- Named, specific vessels: spacecraft, vehicles, and other aircraft.
- Major works of art and artifice, such as albums, books, video games, films, musicals, operas, symphonies, paintings, sculptures, newspapers, journals, magazines, epic poems, plays, television programs or series, radio shows, comics and comic strips.
- Use italics for the scientific names of floras, animals, and all other organisms. Eg. *draco sapiens*.
- Use italics for phrases in other languages (Ramathian, Ykili, etc.) and for isolated foreign words that are not common in everyday English. Eg. *thill*, *arden*, etc.

####

## Units of measurement

All units of measurement should be provided using the Metric system.

## Earth similies

Please do not reference Earth (Terran) events or Humans when contributing to the wiki. Earth does not exist in our game. You should avoid writing descriptors such as:

- "similar to an Earth crocodile"
- "fox-like"
- "like Harry Potter"

## Accepted abbreviations

- The proper abbreviation of [Pendragon](/species/pendragon) is *'dragon* (with the leading apostrophe).
- The proper abbreviation of [Feydragon](/species/feydragon) is *Fey*.

## Media files

### Images

Images uploaded should be in **.png** format.

## Spelling

A quick spellcheck before saving your edit is greatly appreciated.

### British/Canadian or American spelling?

Either spelling is *correct*, so do not unnecessarily edit articles to change the spelling. However, as Shadowlack is based out of Canada, the default spelling is **Canadian English**.
