**Lyrox'de Cuhlar** is a character from Ramathian legend, and part of the mythos surrounding the ancient Swarian Warlord [Nuji Kaztohaat](/characters/nuji-kaztohaat "wikilink"). Sometimes Lyrox was an ally, sometimes he was an enemy, and always he preferred guile and sorcery over brute force. However, since he is often depicted with the spear *Tsaupvuts Tsjeca* ("Steadfast Strike"), he may have occasionally fought in battle himself as a last resort.
