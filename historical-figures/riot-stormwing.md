Her base color is a medium brown tone, which can lighten or darken depending on the seasons. She also has six white markings which look like bands: one around her muzzle, one around each wrist and ankle, and the last around the base of her tail. Her ears, fingers, toes, and tail are tipped in a matching white shade. Her hair, which is also white though the tips are often dyed a myriad of colors, is choppy, spiky, and it falls just short of her shoulder blades when she wears it down. Meanwhile, her left eye is a bright green color, while the right is startlingly blue.

Physiologically, Riot is a rather slender and spry creature. When she’s in her feral form, she’s roughly the same size as an Earthen wolf, with a short, sharp muzzle and large ears. She’s 26 inches at the shoulder, and weighs 88 lbs. In her bipedal shift, she looks about the same, save for the fact that she walks on two feet, has anthropomorphic features like breasts, and stands at the height of 5 feet, 6 3/4 inches and weighs in at 123 lbs. In either shift, she has a downwards facing pouch in which she can store anything, from plushes to food to future offspring. She also has feathery white wings, which she can make appear and disappear at will.

When it comes to clothing and accessories, Riot’s tastes vary. She can often be found in tight tees along with jeans or capris, though she rarely wears shorts or skirts. She favors clothing that shows off her figure without being “sluttish,” and often wears shirts with open backs. As for jewelry, she has several piercings along her large ears, as well as a stud and chain in her navel and another in her tongue. Riot sometimes wears necklaces, bracelets, and anklets, but her only constant pieces of jewelry are the engagement ring on her left hand and the promise band on her right, both, of course, given to her by Cayson.

Personality
-----------

Riot has a very fluid personality. Most of the time, she is fairly laidback and sensible, and she’s definitely the type that loves to hang out with her friends and joke around. She can be very affectionate, and her sense of humor is wickedly adorable. On the flip side, when she feels something unjust has been done to her, she will react quite aggressively and “dominantly,” and put the offender in his or her place. She stands up for justice, and it’s one of the things she values most in life. Besides looking out for herself, she also loyally tends to her friends, making sure that nobody messes with them.

History
-------

Riot has no real recollection of her distant past. Her first significant memories center on her enrolment in Janardan Academy. Everything prior to that is as much as forgotten. Her parents, as well as any other family members, are unknown, and Riot may very well never know how she came to be or whether she has ties anywhere.
