The father of legendary [Warlord Nuji Kaztohaat](/historical-figures/nuji-kaztohaat "wikilink"), and a strong Warlord in his own right. Saios inherited the throne from his father, who had been killed in battle against a clan of Myshemd Fey. However, he only enjoyed power for so long; his wicked brother Ortyos wanted to be Warlord himself.

Ortyos led a coup, killing Saios's beloved wife Ethinbru and many good soldiers. The Warlord himself was forced to flee, taking Nuji with him. From there they went into hiding, growing up among a Kynnyn Fey clan. Once Nuji came of age, with the help of the clan, he returned and defeated Ortyos.

Saios chose to remain with the Fey and became the clan's guardian. He protected them until his death, when he was poisoned by a wicked half-Myshemd. The assassin was later killed by her own sister.
