A poet who lived "during Dragyn times". At some point in his life, he began writing controversial poems about atrocities committed "in the name of the Magos". Karos' last poem talked about his ideal society and hinted that he planned to become Arch Magos himself; regardless, several days after it was published he attempted to assassinate the then Arch Magos. He was shot and killed by one of the bodyguards.
