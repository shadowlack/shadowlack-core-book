He was a very successful [Menlo](/entertainment/menlo "wikilink") player. He had won many Official Menlo Matches and even got as far as to battle the famed [Raebin Yanq'fal](/historical-figures/raebin-yanqfal "wikilink"). Kalkoru was claimed the winner as Raebin mysteriously died during their match. Kalkoru did not win that tournament, and went back to practising and battling in other Official Menlo Matches. His career was shadowed however by the theory of some Raebin fans that Kalkoru was somehow responsible for the death of the famed player. He retired from the game that winter being unable to handle the constant accusations.
