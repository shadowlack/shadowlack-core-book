**Zamfir Grader** (Tessera 50, 81273 – Mia 22, 81380) was the reigning Arch Magos of Ramath-lehi between the years 81343 and 81380. Zamfir came from the noble Grader family – a wealthy and powerful line of mages. His control over Fronima was a highly commendable one. Known for his strength and strong leadership skills, Zamfir only wanted the best for Ramath-lehi. His accomplishments were many and it can certainly be said that he made countless improvements to the planet.

When Karryasa passed on, Zamfir suffered the news horribly. Distraught, the Arch Magos inflicted wounds upon himself. Shortly after he was subdued and put into a special care facility on Ajita. His condition is said to have gotten progressively worse. Overcome with grief on Mia 22, 81380, Zamfir suffered a fatal heart attack, or as some would say, he died of a broken heart.
