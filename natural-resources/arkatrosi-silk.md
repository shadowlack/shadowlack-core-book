**Arkatrosi Silk** is considered to be one of the finest materials on all of Ramath-lehi and many Ramathians sing praises about it for its softness, versatility, and superior quality. It is often farmed and woven into textiles that are then sold for outrageously high prices. In its purest form, it is naturally bright white in colour and has a very uniform texture. It is a silk that readily takes to dyes and as such comes in a wide variety of colours.

Silk from the Arkatrosi farms in Boreios Sudesha is the most lucrative and sought-after luxury item traded across all of Ramath-lehi. Silk is produced year round in Boreios Sudesha.
