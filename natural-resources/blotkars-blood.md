The **Blotkars**, a domesticated animal native to Trilok, has blood that has a similar effect to alcohol on Ramathians who drink it. Because of this, a thriving industry has developed based on drinks made from this blood, nicknamed "blood booze". The blood is often processed to have a stronger effect, and can be mixed with various other beverages to create unique cocktails. "Blood booze" is primarily produced in Trilok, as that is where the vast majority of domestic Blotkars herds are kept.
