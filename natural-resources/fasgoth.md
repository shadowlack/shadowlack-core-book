**Fasgoth** is a natural resource that can only be found on the moon Xabu which orbits Ramath-lehi. It is naturally a light pink colour, and is very translucent. It is a relatively popular mineral, as it was found to actually repel water in a way that seems to defy gravity. It is often combined with other minerals and put into clothing in order to keep them both dry, and stain-free. Another interesting use for Fasgoth is in dinnerware, namely glasses and drinking cups. When liquid is placed inside of these cups, it tends to hover in the middle, never touching any of the sides. If the cup is pure Fasgoth, learning how to drink out of it for the first time can be a bit of a challenge, and often results in the drink being spilt all over the person attempting to consume it. Dining with Fasgoth is a bit of an art, and having drinking glasses made out of it is considered to be a luxury. However the most popular use of Fasgoth is in building construction. Fasgoth ingestion is fatal.
