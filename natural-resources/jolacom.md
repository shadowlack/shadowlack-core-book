Jolacom is a soft reddish gold mineral that is naturally occurring on Ramath-lehi. It may be found only in the Tmu and Uhai Deserts of the Sudeshas where it has become a popular commodity of the Anubi. In these deserts, it may be found deep underground, often in concentrated patches that sprout out with long tendril-like veins. Jolacom has a very special property, and is often seen as a the antithesis of Fronimium. High concentrations of Jolacom can actually block out a Ramathianâ€™s connection to Fronima. This makes it incredibly effective when attempting to detain someone who has very high magical abilities. One of the most notable prisons, Krokino Prison in the Tmu Desert, is made almost entirely out of Jolacom. Its cells are lined and packed with dense Jolacom bricks. When Ramathians are subjected to Jolacom in high densities, such as when being an inmate at Krokino Prison for many years, their magical abilities actually weaken. Depending upon how long they were subjected to the mineral, the majority of Ramathians will eventually regain their abilities once taken out of a Jolacom-infested area. Unfortunately the recovery time varies between individuals, and can often take years even if the subject was only a prisoner for a month.

Ingesting Jolacom will cause the subject to experience a feeling of light-headedness, disembodiment, and weakened magic. These effects will generally go away after the mineral has passed through the system. Injected Jolacom into the bloodstream has much more devastating effects. Habitually injected Jolacom has been said to be able to cut the ties to Fronima completely. As a result, Jolacom has gained a very large following of Rapitelli (Rapine Worshippers), who see it as an essential part of getting closer to the Rapine.
