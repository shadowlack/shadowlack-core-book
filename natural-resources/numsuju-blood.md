Located only in the frozen depths of the underwater caves in the seas near [Dhruv](/countries/dhruv), and the Sagar Sea and Krishna Sea Islands, **numsuju blood** is a rare commodity. It is harvested from the rare amphibian, [numsuju](/faunas/numsuju).

It is very magical and is prized for its ability to cleanse viruses from deathly ill Ramathians. Numsuju blood is used widely in a lot of popular medicines as its ability to cure is faster than most traditional methods. Unfortunately it is unable to remove all viruses, and has absolutely no effect on [magia morbii](/conditions).
