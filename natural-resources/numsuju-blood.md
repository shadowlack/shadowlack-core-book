Located only in the frozen depths of the underwater caves in the seas near Dhruv, and the Sagar Sea and Krishna Sea Islands, Numsuju Blood is a rare commodity. It is very magical and is prized for its ability to cleanse viruses from deathly ill Ramathians. Numsuju Blood is used widely in a lot of popular medicines as its ability to cure is faster than most traditional methods. Unfortunately it is unable to remove all viruses, and has absolutely no effect on magia morbii.
