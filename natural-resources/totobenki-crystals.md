Totobenki Crystals are small crystals that are roughly three inches long and two inches thick. They look very similar to shards of ice with bright blue spheres in the centre. They may only be obtained by finding and killing a Totobenki, or waiting for a Totobenki to die of natural causes. Totobenki often appear in Trilok and Dhruv where they are regularly farmed for their crystals. The Totobenki Crystals are a Fronima source, commonly used as a battery in high-energy consuming machina (like the Portal Transportation System), or to research devastating elemental spells.

Machina technology uses these crystals by attaching gold contacts to either side and drawing Fronima into a polarized crystal capsule for use. Magical practitioners either mix the crystal with other items or use them as part of a mage’s staff in order to amplify one’s existing magical abilities.

Due to its rarity, the Totobenki Crystal is also an expensive precious jewel, commonly worn for ceremonies or highly important social excursions. In their polished forms, the Totobenki Crystals are either stretched, blue marble-like ovals, or compact, blue swirled pearls.
