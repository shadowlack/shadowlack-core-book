Draconan Krankheit isn't the good kind of famous. More like he has written a legacy of himself in blood. Remorseless and vicious, Draconan is a foreboding predator. His prey are found brutally maimed, often burned and killed in some of the most bloody ways imaginable. He always leaves his prey, he never tries to dispose of them, nor cover up the fact he did it. It wasn't long before witnesses sighted him, but no one ever had the bravery to call him in. Even to this day he eludes officials and hunters. No one knows how old he is, where he was born, or even if he has any living relatives. He is also rumoured that he suffers from frequent mood swing type symptoms.
