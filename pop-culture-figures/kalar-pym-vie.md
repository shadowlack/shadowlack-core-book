Kalar Pym Vie is an author and comic book writer. She is most famous for her work with [Larr Svulie](/pop-culture-figures/larr_svulie "wikilink") on *The White Vajjas*, a graphic novel series; her other works include *Twenty-Nine Nights* and *Lightning That Can't Strike* (working with artist [JL Bekel](/pop-culture-figures/jl_bekel "wikilink") for both of these). Pym Vie's style involves heavy use of metafiction, as well as constant use of complex, overarching plotlines.
