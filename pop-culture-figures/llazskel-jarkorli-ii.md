The current ruler of Trilok. As his family does not hold the power it once held, he usually works alongside the country's ruling parliament. As the high king, he is the one who has the final say in what becomes the country's law; he also has the power to overrule decisions made in parliament if need be. He can even dismiss parliament members from their positions if need be, though he has not yet done so during his time as king.

Before he became the king, he was an officer in Trilok's military. He was even extended an offer to join the USR, but he refused.
