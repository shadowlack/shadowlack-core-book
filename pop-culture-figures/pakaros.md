All about .

Appearance
----------

The first thing anyone would notice about Pakaros is that s/he is dead. Or, more specifically, *un*dead - s/he is now little more than an animated skeleton with two lights in his/her eye sockets. S/he is always clad in the traditional garments of a mage.

Judging from the horns jutting from his/her skull, one can assume that s/he was a Lukuo when s/he was alive.

In addition s/he can use illusion magic to disguise him/herself as one of the living. When s/he does, however, s/he takes on a variety of forms of different race, age and gender. S/he can even alter his/her voice to match his/her disguises. All this helps to elude the Council, and it has worked largely thanks to his/her skill.

### Family

### Friends

### Enemies

As the leader of the Free Mages, Pakaros sees the Council of Thirteen as his/her enemy for how they handled the Flux. However, rumour has it that the undead 'dragon's hatred of the Council goes back much, much further than this...
