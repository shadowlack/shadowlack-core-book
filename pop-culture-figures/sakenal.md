Sakenal is the stage name used by the frontman and lead vocalist of the six-member feydragon rock band [Chaos Theory](/entertainment/chaos_theory "wikilink"). While every member of the band is capable of singing, Sakenal is by and large their most versatile and powerful vocalist, and has incredible charisma on stage. He is rumoured to be an Azetsum, but remains quiet on the matter. Aside from their music, he and his group are known for their work in breaking down the social barriers between Feydragons and mainstream Ramathian society; because of this they use stage names to protect their identities.
