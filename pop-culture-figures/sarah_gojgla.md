At a young age, Sarah had a voice inside her that wanted her to let it out through song, that's why she had an interest in singing. It wasn't just the thought of words that made her sing a song, something like a scene or event always inspired her to sing a certain song. She just like a normal average rock star, nothing else. An example, like *What Are You Fighting For?*, that was inspired by a war, which is partial rock and instrumental and *Am I Too Lost?*, that inspires by people trying to find salvation, which is all rock.
