Azsampap Apokuseym is for advanced learners, who prefer to extend the lesson and go deeper into thought. It is a public school, accepting all or any students at the age of twelve and up. If the student does not participate, there will be an immediate recommendation for another school. Azsampap Apokuseym is a moderately strict school, with a dress code required. It covers about all topics, but is renown for teaching Zoology.
