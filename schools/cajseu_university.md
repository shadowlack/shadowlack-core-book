Cajseu University takes its name from Oumha Kertia, the founder of the school many generations back. As he was noted for his remarkable intelligence and high expectations, the school follows a similar mindset. The University trains students ages ten to twenty, and focuses solely on trades which involve intellect, such as Law, Mathematics and Psychology. Magical or physical trades are not trained here; students who wish to train in such trades must go elsewhere.
