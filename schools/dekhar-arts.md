*Whoever said that magic and swordplay are mutually exclusive is a fool.*

--Widely attributed to **Tier'gan Rovzakla**, the founder of the Lakrathsir school

Magic and martial arts are not mutually exclusive; there are a number of schools that blend the two in some way, shape or form. These are collectively referred to as the **dekhar arts**, after Fiddekh, the [Tanalist](/Tanalism "wikilink") goddess of war.

Dekhar art schools
------------------

-   **Lakrathsir**: One of the oldest surviving dekhar arts, founded by Tier'gan Rovzakla. Rovzakla used an innovative form of [Elemental Sorcery](/Elemental_Sorcery "wikilink") to channel elemental magic through her sword; with simple command words she could set the blade on fire, coat it with ice, make it crackle with lightning, alter the metal it was made out of, or make it swing effortlessly through the air. Today, practitioners of this school can apply this method to various weapons, focus on a singular element, or stay true to Rovzakla's original teachings.
