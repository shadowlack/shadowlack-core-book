Dula Ukupani, a school for flying pendragons, is located on Sucam Island. There are boats scattered in the surrounding area for those too weak to make the whole flight. They'll teach any one from the ages of five to fifty in flight, only if they can get there. They also teach Acrobatics, Running, and in special cases, Elemental Magic. Most are afraid to come because of all the nasty rumours they hear about the founder. The founder was a terrifying pendragon who made her students fight to survive with their wings, and didn't take lightly on thrill-seekers. They uphold that tradition today. All in all one must be strong and serious to get in.
