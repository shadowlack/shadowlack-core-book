Only accepts members of the Anubial subspecies, so while the school itself is quite large, the attendance is low due to the small numbers of remaining Anubi. There is no age limit as to who can enroll, and most parents have their children attending by age five. They teach all trades, though they seem to specialize in the 'Darker Arts': more than a few Necromancers have come from the House of Anpu, though the also see many students who specialize in magic involving Darkness and Shadows, Artistry (which includes architecture, tattooing, painting, drawing, and sculpture), Astrology, Herbs and Medicine, Languages, History, Guardians and Protectors, Elemental Sorcery, as well as Elemental Kinesis trades.
