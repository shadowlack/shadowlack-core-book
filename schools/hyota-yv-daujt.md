(Referred to as "Daujit" or Gear. The name means "House of Gears") The school specializes in mechanics, and technology. Think of them as the MIT of Ramath-lehi. They're known for their mischievous and clever pranks, as well as their engineering masterpieces. With some of the brightest minds around, Daujit is hard to get into, but the truly dedicated will find it to be one of the best schools for their mechanical profession. It's also rumoured to contain a centre where seriously injured high-ranking Ramathians can go so that they might not have to amputate that limb after all... at least not in the way they thought. But who listens to silly rumours? It should also be noted that Daujit takes only apprentice level and up. Students are expected to have a basic knowledge from elsewhere beforehand.

They're really good at Harok racing, but were disqualified one year because their Harok turned out to be a machine magicked to look like a Harok.
