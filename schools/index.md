Most are afraid to come because of all the nasty rumours they hear about the founder.

With some of the brightest minds around, Daujit is hard to get into, but the truly dedicated will find it to be one of the best schools for their mechanical profession. It's also rumoured to contain a center where seriously injured high-ranking Ramathians can go so that they might not have to amputate that limb after all...at least not in the way they thought. But who listens to silly rumours? It should also be noted that Daujit takes only apprentice level and up. Students are expected to have a basic knowledge from elsewhere beforehand.
