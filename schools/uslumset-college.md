Uslumset College is a private school for people who are willing to pay up the money to spend thier kids to a high-end school. The school really likes to focus on the improvement of their students and have been known to spit out some now very famous scientists. They also like to work with anything that has to do with water, using the undersea city as one of their main projects to study. They don't really care what the young pendragons major in, for the money they pay they will find a teacher for the kid. They will accept any child between the ages of eight to eighteen.
