**Junsui** (Kathleen/Zeva) - Ever wonder who the brains were behind the entire Ramathian language? Where the Ramathian font came from? Who created a significant amount of flora and fauna? You owe your thanks to Kathleen. She's forever shaped this site and will never be forgotten. Thank you, Junsui! (2003 - 2005)
