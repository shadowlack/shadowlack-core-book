Hello! I'm a long-time member of Shadowlack. I'm not a very active roleplayer here - however, this was the site that made me fall in love with worldbuilding, and as such I've become one of the site's most active worldbuilders. I'm actually happy with how things have worked out; by adding to the lore of the setting, I get to contribute to the ongoing story of Ramath-lehi in my own way, and the more active roleplayers get to benefit from my contributions.

This didn't go unnoticed, either - when Jodie asked me if I wanted to be the site's first Shaper, I jumped at the opportunity!

Aside from this site I'm a tabletop gamer; I'm currently playing in a Dungeons and Dragons campaign and a Mutants and Masterminds campaign, and me and my gaming group have games for Ironclaw, Jadeclaw and Mutant Chronicles (an obscure Swedish RPG my boyfriend grew up playing) in the works. I'm also an amatuer cartoonist/comic artist, with one zine published (sadly not available in electronic format), and I'm hoping to become a professional visual designer (preferably a draftsman). I'm also something of a metalhead, with a preference for power metal, though my tastes in music are pretty eclectic.

## Shadowlack characters

(I totally did not steal this from phylus. >_> )

- [Binail Hachuan](/characters/binail-hachuan)
    - An animal-loving, intellectual Alanamsul Feydragon. Occasionally gets caught up in clan politics due to being the son of a Court scribe/secretary.
- [Marei Kynigos](/characters/marei-kynigos)
    - A Kynnyn Feydragon and headhunter. Has a case of Foot-in-Mouth Syndrome and can come off as a jerk, but in reality isn't too bad when not on "duty".
