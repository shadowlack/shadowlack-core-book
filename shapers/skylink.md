Woot. Skylink, your epic awesome lurker mod here.

Well, as stressful as college is, i'm still looking over everyone's shoulders, readin ur threadz, and eatin ur snax nom nom nom nom.. :F

Anyway, tis besides the point. I always 'return' here for odd reasons, but not this time. Why? I didn't leave yet. =p Lurker mods never leave.

Well, In order to keep Jodz from demoting me, I'm going to be doing my part as a self-elected content manager. Y'know. Just the usual rereading/writing of the Guides and articles in the Compendium.

Well, that's Skylink for ya, maybe one day I'll have this filled up with some background info on myself.

Ehh... procrastination's kicking in.. I'll do it later. Chau =p
