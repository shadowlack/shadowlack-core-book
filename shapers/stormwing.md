There are three members who have Ramath-lehi moons named after them. Kat happens to be one of them (Cussla). Kat will most likely be remembered for her smart writing skills and creativity. While at Ramath-lehi she contributed greatly to the plots and further development of the site as a whole. We wish her the best. (2003 - 2006)
