**Shadowlack** was first established online in July of 2002. At that time it was known as *Ramath-lehi*.

## Site origins

![Jargon Kavner from The Comic](/images/site-history/jargon_kavner.jpg){.align-right} Ramath-lehi has a past that not too many people know about. Well, unless they've read this page anyway. The concept for Ramath-lehi started in 1997. It wasn't known as Ramath-lehi then, but simply as *The Comic*. The Comic was just that, an ongoing pencil comic book (on lined paper no less). Its three main collaborators were Andrea L. (*Wolf Paws*), April P., and Jodie Struthers (*Shriker*). There were a few guest artists, but none of them really played any significant parts to be mentioned. Most of the time the artists felt like fugitives. Passing *The Comic* during school while the teacher was talking to add more to it. On several occasions it was confiscated and the three were forced to look at it longingly, sitting on the corner of the teacher's desk, until the end of the day when it could be retrieved.

*The Comic* itself consists of around 220 or more pages, each divided into 6 panels and drawn on front and back. So we're looking at over **2600** individual panel drawings here. The earlier drawings in it were done in pen (and later made the transition into pencil). Hasty scribbles with goofy characters that contained a lot of jokes about games, blowing things up, shadow creatures, and Science experiments.

Then came the [Pendragons](/species/pendragon).

![Some magic going on.](/images/site-history/on_three.jpg){.align-right} Jodie's parents went on a vacation to Germany, leaving Jodie and her siblings with their Nana. However, one of the siblings was infested. With head lice. Which... led to a not-so-fun vacation at all for everyone involved. There were a few highlights though. Like the trip to Collingwood's Scenic Caves, and the playing of many, many, PlayStation games (which sort of sucked because they didn't have a memory card).

All of this sprouted the creation of the very first Pendragon: *Seth Lorax Dragyn*. Seth made his first appearance in *The Comic* as a "not so lost" little alien with a fetish for marshmallows and shapeshifting.

The introduction of Seth caused some major changes to *The Comic*. Within no time at all, Pendragons had inflitrated its pages and completely took over. Seth's family, the [Dragyn](/genealogy/dragyn)'s (a family dedicated to space exploration and colonization), were looking for him. The planet Seth was on (called "Earth" just because it was similar to our own planet) was in danger. A plague-like species (think of soul stealing locusts) called the [Rapine](/species/rapine) were set to invade. The [Graders](/genealogy/grader) were introduced as well as a few other prominent figures. There was a strange incident involving eating clams and then hallucinating. [Karryasa Grader](/characters/karryasa-grader) blew a few things up using her telepathic powers. All in all, it was pretty cool.

![Karryasa and Zamfir Grader.](/images/site-history/old_graders.jpg){.align-right} So then comes this thing called the internet. For a while Jodie had been joining, running, and maintaining a wide variety of online roleplaying games. It took a while, but then kind of hit her: *Gee, I wonder what a Pendragon game would be like?* So July of 2002 swings around. Jodie, with sign off and permission of *The Comic*'s co-creators, begins construction of the game. For the longest time they were leery of putting things online, but it all worked out somehow.

Ever since then, Ramath-lehi has been growing and developing as it continues to be shaped by its players.

## Past incarnations

What Shadowlack has looked like over the years.

### War (Jul. 2002 to Nov./Dec.)

[![War](/images/site-history/2002-07-war-thumb.jpg){.align-left}](/images/site-history/2002-07-war.jpg) This was Ramath-lehi's very first layout. It wasn't very browser friendly, but then again, it was my first attempt at coding a "real" web site. The top banner was just some random free clipart that I found of some cougar eyes. It was pretty simple... and the colours sure were something. Acid green and orange?

### Iversia Seneca (Jan. 2003 to Mar. 2003)

[![Iversia Seneca](/images/site-history/2003-01-iversia-thumb.jpg){.align-left}](/images/site-history/2003-01-iversia.jpg) Our second layout featured Iversia Seneca, one of my own characters. She was the arch rival of Karryasa Grader during Ramath-lehi's "comic" days. This layout featured iFrames. Unfortunately as I quickly found out, there were quite a few people out there with browsers that didn't support iFrames. So, while it was a nice layout, it got tossed quickly.

### Bones (Mar. 2003 to Sept. 2003)

[![Bones](/images/site-history/2003-03-bones-thumb.jpg){.align-left}](/images/site-history/2003-03-bones.jpg) A lot of people seemed to like this one. :] It was really fast loading as the navigation was all simple text links... but um, notice the headers? Yes. That's rotting flesh hanging from that poor dead critter's ribcage, and yep, that's blood slowly leaking out of that pendragon skull. While I personally liked this layout a lot, it proved to be just a *little* too intimidating. I think I scared off quite a few newcomers... not to mention what parents would think if they saw their kids surfing a web site with some huge ass bleeding skull. So while it was cool and creepy/morbid while it lasted, it still wasn't quite "right."

### Cayson Lapices (Sept. 2003 to Oct. 30th, 2003)

[![Cayson Lapices](/images/site-history/2003-09-cayson-thumb.jpg){.align-left}](/images/site-history/2003-09-cayson.jpg) I disliked this layout. It featured another one of my characters - Cayson Lapices. It wound up being too cartoony and childish for my liking. Not to mention is was very slow loading. Starting about here though I began to really learn how to code things with PHP and MySQL though.

### The Graders (Oct. 30th, 2003 to Jul. 25th, 2004)

[![The Graders](/images/site-history/2003-10-graders-thumb.jpg){.align-left}](/images/site-history/2003-10-graders.jpg) I really liked this layout. The colour blends (at least to me) were very appealing. Somehow it also reminded me of the Final Fantasy series. The only thing that I didn't like was the JavaScript menu at the top. See, Ramath-lehi is a growing site. Because of that, we ended up accumulating A LOT of informational links... and unfortunately all of these ended up being stuck into that menu bar. The end result? We ended up scaring quite a few potential members away by confusing them with our content links. I decided to opt for a more "newbie friendly" site design. Thus began the era of the New Player Guide and the joining quiz.

### Dreamcatcher (Jul. 25th, 2004 to Jul. 3rd 2005)

[![Dreamcatcher](/images/site-history/2004-06-dreamcatcher-thumb.jpg){.align-left}](/images/site-history/2004-06-dreamcatcher.jpg) This layout was something. It reminds me of a nightclub rave. The colours are bright, but blend well enough together so as not to be an eyesore. I cut down on the navigational links, and instead created a "Member Area", specially coded so that only approved members can read the special content that I put there. Sure it's a little strange with the really wide sidebar, and really not all that practical... but it is a change.

## Platform history

- Ramath-lehi's first forum in 2002 was an *ezBoard*. It was short-lived.
- It was quickly replaced by the Perl-based *Ikonboard* with a flat file database.
- In 2003, when new resources allowed it, Ramath-lehi switched over to using a mySQL database with *Invision Power Board* (1.3).
- In 2009, Ramath-lehi migrated to *phpBB*. It was heavily modified with custom code for character roleplaying.
