## Planetary overview

| Name  | Type  | Distance | Mass | Radius | Atmosphere |
| :---- | :---- | :---     | :--- | :---   | :---       |
| [Redveja](/solar-system/redveja) | Sun | | | | Hot plasma (ionized gas) with no firm surface. |
| [Firsamus](/solar-system/rirsamus) | Venusian | | | | Hot, arid, cloudy, boiling ocean. Thick and poisonous atmosphere. |
| [Rojmemd](/solar-system/rojmemd) | Rock | | | | Hot, airless. |
| [Telkan](/solar-system/telkan) | Pelagic (Water) | 0.907 AU | 0.925 M<sub>⊕</sub> | 0.975 R<sub>⊕</sub>| Warm, breathable. (N2, O2) |
| [Ramath-lehi](/solar-system/ramath-lehi) | Terrestrial | 1.027 AU[^1] | 1.376 M<sub>⊕</sub>[^2] | 1.109 R<sub>⊕</sub>[^3] | Cool, breathable. (N2, O2)  |
| [Scatranis](/solar-system/scatranis) | Asteroid field | | | | None or very tenuous. |
| [Nitsaji](/solar-system/nitsaji) | Space anomaly | | | | Turbulent, saturated with toxic chemicals and thermionic radiation. |

## Solar system highlights

- Colonized moons of Ramath-lehi, Xabu and Cussla.
- [Therscatran Gate](/countries/therscatran-gate) space port, in the Scatranis asteroid field.

[^1]: Astronomical unit (AU), a unit of length, roughly the distance from Earth to the Sun and equal to about 150 million kilometres.
[^2]: Earth mass (M<sub>⊕</sub>), is the unit of mass equal to that of the Earth. 1 M<sub>⊕</sub> = 5.9742×1024 kg. In our case, Ramath-lehi is slightly bigger than Earth.
[^3]: Earth radius (R<sub>⊕</sub>) is the distance from the centre of Earth to a point on its surface. This measurement is an approximation as the value has a range.
