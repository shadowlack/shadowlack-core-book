Although capable of space flight, the planet Ramath-lehi has chosen to limit its interaction with other alien species. Its [rulers](/culture/government), perhaps ethnocentric, felt that it was best to remain a separate entity. So the universe around the planet continues to intermingle and flourish, while Ramath-lehi remains isolated in its bubble.

Considered to be an aloof planet by the majority of alien species, Ramath-lehi is decidedly content with its separatism. Trade between other alien species is sometimes conducted however it is rare. Instead the government of Ramath-lehi focuses intently on its own economy. Trade between Ramathian countries is high and the planet itself is rich in resources, life, and strong currency.

Trade is the strongest between the two countries [Ajita](/countries/ajita), the machina-powered floating country, and [Aurius](/countries/aurius), the country that lurks beneath the Sumundra sea.
