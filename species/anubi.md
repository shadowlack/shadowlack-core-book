The **Anubi** \[ˈa nuˌbaj\] are a scarce race that almost met extinction due to targeted biological warfare.

Anubi are fiercely protective of their culture and see all other races as inferior. Some are so strong in their beliefs that the Anubi bloodline should remain pure that they have turned to illegal cloning and genetic alteration laboratories.

Anubi have tall pointed ears, narrow faces with long snouts, lithe and muscular frames, and long, thin tails. They appear naturally with the following combination of colours: tangerine, rust, beige, silver, tan, white, and black. Those with untrue colours to the Anubi race are often considered unclean by other Anubi. Eye colourations are gold, amber, black, dark brown, blue, green, or white, and sometimes are completely without visible pupils.

> Anubi are known for their ability to survive in extreme desert climates. Anubi have a knack for Necromancy, magic involving darkness and shadows, Artistry, Astrology, Herbs and Medicine, Languages, History, Elemental Sorcery, and Elemental Kinesis.

### Sexual Dimorphism

There is no distinguishing differences between sexes. Both male and female Anubi have slender and feminine appearances. Their thin frames and graceful movements are much akin to those of a dancer — agile yet strong.

### Reproduction

Anubi are picky about who they choose as a mate. When they do choose, it is for life, and no bond could be greater. The Anubi frown upon marriage between different subspecies of Pendragon, preferring to breed within their own dying bloodlines. Because of this, and the small number of Anubi, their blood is quite weak.

Anubi would do almost anything in order to keep their ancient and royal bloodlines pure and untainted. Some have been so strong in their beliefs that the bloodline should remain pure that they have gone about trying to keep it this way through illegal cloning and genetic alterations.

> Anubi halflings are highly frowned upon and shunned by the general Anubi populace. Practitioners of the Anubian religion regularly put Anubi halflings to death.

### Health

Anubi are extremely susceptible to disease due to inbreeding.

## Culture

### Religion

The Anubi have a religion (Anubian) that differs from the rest of the world. It is cantered around central gods that manifest themselves in hidden temples that are scattered around the deserts.

## Habitat

It is a known fact that the Anubi Pendragons of old were an advanced society. They isolated themselves from other Pendragons, believing them to be unclean. The Anubi lived in tribes deep in the hearts of deserts where no other Pendragon subspecies with normal mind would dare to venture.

Ancient Anubi architecture can still be found in the Uhai Desert, and a few small Anubi tribes still take up residence there, their numbers not much more than a few thousand. An even smaller population of Anubi can be found in Swaraj in the Pwa Desert. The most distinguished tribe of Anubi (the Anubi Yv sha Ledhs) however, can be found in the southern desert regions of Notios Sudesha around the Tmu Desert. This particular tribe has been entrusted with the management of the Krokino Prison, where the most deadly and hostile of criminal offenders are sent when death just isn’t an option.

Anubi used stone and glass as their main building materials, making large sparkling structures in the middle of the deserts. Their main means of transportation was foot, believing in those times that machines and machina would cause evil. Other means of transportation were altogether unnecessary due to the fact that their settlements were close enough together that faster and more efficient modes of transportation were never desired.

## History

During the Ramathian year 50,000, a strange and undocumented illness wreaked havoc upon the Anubi tribes, who by that time were thriving and one of the largest subspecies of Pendragons. Many fell victim to this bizarre Anubi-only disease. No remedies could be found, and it was thought that it was a magic-created virus, yet no counter-spells or healing could cure it. Those with it slowly deteriorated. In less than two years, the entire population of Anubi Pendragons was nearly wiped out. A few select survivors made it out of the strangling clot of disease, but to this day, they have never regained their vast numbers.
