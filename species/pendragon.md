Extremely versatile and telepathically connected to Fronima, the **Pendragon** \[ˈpʰɛnˌdɹæ gjn̩\] is the most prolific race on the planet Ramath-lehi. Pendragons have furry bodies and long whip-like tails. All Pendragons fall into one (or two) of the following appearance types:

- **Felid.** Short or sometimes non-existent snouts, sharp triangular ears, and small noses. 
- **Canid.** Long snouts, large ears, and fleshy noses. 
- **Draconic.** Long snouts, sometimes no protruding ears, and serpentine nostril slits.

Most male Pendragons have flickering Fronima flames on the tips of their tails. The tail-flame mutation can also occur in females, but it is not as common. 85% of male Pendragons have tail-flames compared to 27% of females. Males born without tail-flames are often called nullfires, which holds negative connotations and implies that the individual lacks magical heritage or power. The colour, size, and appearance of a tail-flames is reflective of a Pendragon's mood and health. All Pendragons are capable of telepathic thought-speak.

Pendragon colours can range dramatically, as they have taken on all of the hues of the visible light spectrum (and perhaps some of the non-visible).
The majority of Pendragons are marked with tattoos. A Pendragon’s first tattoo is usually on their left haunch. These are symbols that their parents thought would reflect the young Pendragon's personality. Parents will often consult a local seer to gain insight as to what a Pendragon's first tattoo should be.
Pendragons are digitigrades, but their paws have evolved for dexterity. They have longer fingers on their forepaws as well as a prehensile thumb which makes it easier for them to work and handle things. They have five toes on each forepaw and back paw. Embedded within the paws are thick, retractable cat-like claws.

Due to their unique body structure, Pendragons are capable of both bipedal and quadrupedal locomotion and can freely switch between either mode. However, if one mode is favoured over the other through most of a Pendragon's life then it will likely affect the shape of the body. For example, a Pendragon who has spent the majority of their childhood in bipedal mode are fairly erect in posture during adulthood.
