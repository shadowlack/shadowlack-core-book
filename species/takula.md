The **Takula** \[ˈtæ kjuˌla\] are a Pendragon subspecies that has been separated in the more remote jungles and dense forest parts of Ramath-lehi. They have evolved to be far more lizard like than any other species, being cold blooded and scaled. They are large, powerful and brooding creatures shrouded in mystery and legend.

The Takula are a small subspecies of Pendragons that are not less evolved but defiantly more acclimatized to certain areas.
They are almost completely reptilian, are cold-blooded and have various other reptile adaptations.

Takula live in packs and tribes but may also be found leading solitary lives. In these tribes they usually have very specific roles they fill out. The tribes themselves are somewhat violent and fight quite often, taking food and prisoners from each other. A strange oddity is that the captured Takula immediately ally with their captor's tribe, completely switching sides. Therefore tribe wars can often be very bizarre with large amount of the tribe members completely switching around.

They are naturally taller than average Pendragons (six feet tall is the minimum height for a Takula) and it not uncommon for them to be a total of eight feet tall when fully grown. The males being naturally more brutish and larger than females but the females are by far more intelligent. They have broad necks, shoulders and all in all resemble reptiles far more than any other creature.

Takula have no fur whatsoever. They are covered in scales that are often very bright and vivid in colours that range from tropical greens to vibrant oranges and reds. Their hands are large and made up of two thick fingers and an opposable thumb. All fingers have wicked two-inch claws on them that can be re-grow if broken and are very helpful for climbing trees and stone surfaces. Their heads often vary quite a bit from individual to individual. They range from having different sized horns to brightly coloured fins or even quills running down the backs of their heads. Takula all have thick tails with the same rules of tail flames as a normal Pendragon, some however have spikes and/or extruding bones showing.

Takula can be very slow and dull witted. However this usually only applies to the males of the subspecies. Though if you cross their paths in the morning when they haven’t had time to bask in the sun, then they all are. They are not stupid though and posses a certain cunning and survivability instincts that not only keep them alive but make them formidable. They can speak English but not perfectly and can sometimes struggle with the language. Takula do not naturally know how to speak Ramathian but the smarter ones can learn it. Takula can write as well but their written language is very simple. They write using a form of hieroglyphics (pictographs).

## Sexual Dimorphism

The Takula do not have many noticeable differences between males and females. While the sexes can often be distinguished by their size, they lack any other traits that make it easy for non-Takula to tell the sexes apart. Takula females do not have breasts, and therefore do not suckle their young.

## Race Mutations

About one in four Takula are born with the skink defect that makes them very small. Skinks are about 90 cm (3 ft) tall and are much more dexterous and faster than the average Takula. They are smarter than average and are able to comprehend more complex ideas in their heads. Due to their intelligence, they often are assigned the role of priest or shaman in the tribe. Skinks are also capable of handling magic.

Takula have a few mutations from the reptile world that some of them possess, some can change the colour of their scales to camouflage themselves in their environment with frightening effectiveness. Some have projectile tongues that they can use, some can even climb up walls thanks to mutations in the finger scales. Takula can swim very well and can last for extreme amounts of time underwater due to their vast lung capacity. There are some more rare mutations among Takula, among these are poisonous bites, tongues which with they can "see" with, and the strangest is that some are born with a strange feathery covering. The majority of these feathers resemble feathery down, which go away around a month after hatching. The larger feathers which actually look like the feathers one would see on a bird are only located on the tail area, the head in a sort of mohawk, and some around the arms. This feather mutation only occurs in about 1 of every 500 Takula, and is considered to be quite attractive. There is a small mutation which is barely noticeable, some Takula are not as small as skinks, but around the same size as the average Pendragon.
