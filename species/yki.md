The **Yki** \[ˈjɪˌki\] are slight and fox-like upon first glance. Their pelts consist of a thick, downy undercoat that traps heat against the body and a long, wiry outer coat that is made up of hollow hairs that capture and retain heat. Muscular, but lean, the Yki are hardy, and able to heal incredibly quickly. They are built to be compact, and light enough to travel over hard packed snow and thin ice without breaking through.

Yki have large ears, and their hair grows especially long around them, sheltering the sensitive organs from frostbite. The Yki are able to fold back their ears, tucking them into the thick fur of the back of their head if needed. The leather of their noses is always black, the only individuals with pink or pale nose leather being albinos and half-Yki. Yki paws are adapted for travel over slick and cold surfaces; their paw-pads have ‘treads’, raised ridges that are unique to each individual. Yki claws are long and hook-like, perfect for snaring a meal or gripping slippery ice. Between their toes grows long, course hair that protects the feet from the elements. The lower portion of their legs also grows longer fur.

Yki introduced to warmer climates will shed their outer coats, leaving only the incredibly thick and luxurious undercoat. When reintroduced to their homelands, the Yki will re-grow the outer coat within a matter of days.

Yki always have white coats, with a secondary colour for markings, hair, and tail flame. Occasionally a male will be born with a black base instead of white, but this is a rare occurrence; it happens no more than 1 in 100 births. If a single kit in a litter bears a black coat, chances are its litter-mates will as well. The only exception to the white/black base rule is half-Yki, whose pelt colour may be affected by their non-Yki parent.

There is a particular hereditary gene found in a few Yki families, particularity the Jori and Tuggheja clans. The gene is recessive, and carried by the female, although it only seems to manifest itself in males. It affects the Yki's secondary colour, reversing the pelts colours so that the secondary colour overwhelms the white base. To all appearances the affected Yki seems to be a reverse of a normal individual, with white markings on a colour base instead of the opposite.

Tribes identify each other by facial tattoos, given when a kit turns five. These tattoos are unique to each tribe, and are added to as the Yki matures; given in recognition of specific events, much like the [grading process](/traditions/grading-system) in use in other parts of the world. A few of the more southern tribes grow out their fur and hair and wear it in dreadlocks, and then adored with beads and other ornaments made of coloured stones or metal.

> Unless you have stated in your character's profile that your character is of non-tribe descent, please include what tribe your character belongs to. Yki have white coats, with a secondary color for markings, hair, and tail flame (in males). If you create a Yki, its base coat should be white.

### Sexual dimorphism

Yki vary widely in size, although females are usually larger than males.

### Reproduction

Unlike Pendragons, Yki are *not oviparous* – that is, they do not lay eggs, instead they give birth to live young. The kits are tiny, but developed and with a full coat of fur. Their fur is very long, giving them the appearance of tiny fur balls. The fur is so long that is conceals their ears, eyes, and most of their muzzle. It is shorter on the face, so that they can nurse adequately. Both female and male Yki have a pouch, much like that of a marsupial, lined with short, fluffy fur that protects the young. The pouch is situated on the lower stomach, the opening facing forward on the females body. The pouch entrance is ringed with strong muscles that can effectively seal up the pouch to keep snow and cool air from reaching any pups inside. Yki litters are usually 1-3, with a large survival rate. Yki only breed every other year, and even then, only when prey is abundant.

### Health

Yki are susceptible to respiratory disease, and whole clans have been wiped out by a strange, pneumonia-like illness. Some of the clans are elitists, and do not condone mating with others outside the tribe; as such at least one clan has been having problems with the newest generation falling victim to genetic diseases such as hip dysplasia.

> Yki start with bonuses to Artistry and Deceive.

### Diet

Yki are strictly carnivores, although the tribe inhabiting the most southern parts of Dhruv do enjoy the occasional vegetarian addition to their diet. Those who live near the coast are excellent fishers, adapting to occasional dip by acquiring an oily secretion on their outer coat that waterproofs their fur.

## Culture

Both Yki arden and thill care for the young, as is evident with the pouch present in both sexes. Yki thill are superb mothers, devoted caregivers that spend long hours grooming, feeding, and looking after their kits. When the mother does have to leave, the father is always there to take over looking after the young until she returns. Yki arden are watchful fathers, and diligent mates, always looking after the mother’s needs to be sure she can care for their kits to the fullest extent.

When the kits are old enough to leave the safety of the home and their parent’s pouches, they are put into a tribal crèche, where older Yki who are unable to hunt watch the kits.

A kits education is the responsibility of the whole tribe, although their limited academic tutelage is usually from a related kiom. Parents teach their children how to hunt and survive in the harsh conditions of their homelands, but once they reach the age of 8 they are apprenticed to one of the adults in the tribe.

At the age of 15, Yki kits go on their first solo hunting mission. If successful, they are accepted into the adult rankings and become fulled fledged warriors of the tribe.

### Social structure

The Yki tribes are made up of several clans united together, and lead by a council made up of the clan elders. The clans, and therefore the tribes as well, are matriarchal; led by the wisest, the strongest, and the most cunning of the female kiom. According to Yki laws, there must always be at least one male on the council in the name of fairness. Tribes claim territories and hunting grounds, and to be caught hunting on another tribes lands incurs the harshest penalties. Most tribes accept, and even encourage, their young adults to seek mates from other tribes. It is customary for the male to join the female’s tribe, becoming a permanent member of his mate’s tribe.

Expulsion from the tribe is the most severe form of punishment, the offending individual forever forbidden from entering the tribe’s lands. To reinforce the punishment, a third of the Yki's tail is removed, along with a large portion of the ears.

Tribes identify each other by facial tattoos, and various styles of body ornamentation. Jewellery and ornamentation of the fur on the head and nape varies from tribe to tribe, and is also used for recognition.

#### Social roles

- **Nioti(e):** The young of the tribe are in charge of a few small chores, such as cleaning out the den and disposing of leftovers. Older Nioti/e help look after kits in the crèche, and assisting the tribe’s kiom.
- **Thill:** Thill usually fill the ranks of the tribe’s warriors, usually being larger and stronger than their male counterparts. The females usually occupy the occupations that require strength, such as smithing, where their size is put to good use. They are usually the more passionate of the Yki, more inclined to follow their heart instead of their head.
- **Arden:** Scout, mages, weavers; males take up the trades that require dexterity, agility, and swiftness. Males tend to be the calmer gender, more logical and levelheaded. Arden also occupy most of the religious fields, and it is often a male kiom that is the tribe's high seer.
- **Kiom-Nushib:** Females who are too old to hunt: the Kiom-Nushib not on the tribe council act as mentors to the younger generation. Adept telepaths, it is rare for them to speak aloud, preferring telepathy instead.
- **Kiom-Weshib:** Males too old to hunt, the Kiom-Weshib are mentors, much like the Kiom-Nushib. Strong mages and shape shifters, they are the spies of a tribe, and the Kiom-Weshib on the tribe council act as the voice of the male half of the tribe.

### Inter-tribal relations

Most tribes get along quite well; encouraging trade and apprentices exchange systems. Some tribes are more introverted than others, but all are wary of outsiders, strange Pendragons who come from the south to study their seemingly *barbaric* lifestyle. 

### Religion

The Yki are spiritual and superstitious people, each tribe worshipping a patron deity. It is not unusual for a tribe shaman or seer to select a kit, and name it the tribe Dyp'khelp, or god child. This child is raised by the tribe priest or priestess, and is the centre of many religious ceremonies within the tribe. The chosen Yki is said to bring good luck, but if killed the tribe will be cursed. It is not uncommon for warring tribes to attempt to kidnap their enemies' Dyp'khelp, for a tribe without their godchild cannot hope to win against those with their deity’s support, and will immediately surrender.

## Habitat

Yki make their home on the continent of Dhruv, and on the sea ice that has this chill habitat landlocked most of the year.
