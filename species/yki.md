The **Yki** \[ˈjɪˌki\] are slight and fox-like upon first glance. Their pelts consist of a thick, downy undercoat that traps heat against the body and a long, wiry outer coat that is made up of hollow hairs that capture and retain heat.

Yki have large ears, and their hair grows especially long around them, sheltering the sensitive organs from frostbite. The Yki are able to fold back their ears, tucking them into the thick fur of the back of their head if needed. The leather of their noses is always black, the only individuals with pink or pale nose leather being albinos and half-Yki. Yki paws are adapted for travel over slick and cold surfaces; their paw-pads have ‘treads’, raised ridges that are unique to each individual. Yki claws are long and hook-like, perfect for snaring a meal or gripping slippery ice. Between their toes grows long, course hair that protects the feet from the elements. The lower portion of their legs also grows longer fur.

Yki introduced to warmer climates will shed their outer coats, leaving only the incredibly thick and luxurious undercoat. When reintroduced to their homelands, the Yki will re-grow the outer coat within a matter of days.

Yki always have white coats, with a secondary colour for markings, hair, and tail flame. Occasionally a male will be born with a black base instead of white, but this is a rare occurrence; it happens no more than 1 in 100 births. If a single kit in a litter bears a black coat, chances are its litter-mates will as well. The only exception to the white/black base rule is half-Yki, whose pelt colour may be affected by their non-Yki parent.

There is a particular hereditary gene found in a few Yki families, particularity the Jori and Tuggheja clans. The gene is recessive, and carried by the female, although it only seems to manifest itself in males. It affects the Yki's secondary colour, reversing the pelts colours so that the secondary colour overwhelms the white base. To all appearances the affected Yki seems to be a reverse of a normal individual, with white markings on a colour base instead of the opposite.

Tribes identify each other by facial tattoos, given when a kit turns five. These tattoos are unique to each tribe, and are added to as the Yki matures; given in recognition of specific events, much like the grading process in use in other parts of the world. A few of the more southern tribes grow out their fur and hair and wear it in dreadlocks, and then adored with beads and other ornaments made of coloured stones or metal.

> Unless you have stated in your character's profile that your character is of non-tribe descent, please include what tribe your character belongs to. Yki almost always have white coats, with a secondary color for markings, hair, and tail flame (in males). If you create a Yki, its base coat should be white.

Yki vary widely in size, although females are usually larger than males. Muscular, but lean, the Yki are hardy, and able to heal incredibly quickly. They are built to be compact, and light enough to travel over hard packed snow and thin ice without breaking through.

Unfortunately, they are susceptible to respiratory disease, and whole clans have been wiped out by a strange, pneumonia-like illness. Some of the clans are elitists, and do not condone mating with others outside the tribe; as such at least one clan has been having problems with the newest generation falling victim to genetic diseases such as hip dysplasia.

Yki are strictly carnivores, although the tribe inhabiting the most southern parts of Dhruv do enjoy the occasional vegetarian addition to their diet. Those who live near the coast are excellent fishers, adapting to occasional dip by acquiring an oily secretion on their outer coat that waterproofs their fur.

## Culture

The Yki tribes are made up of several clans united together, and lead by a council made up of the clan elders. The clans, and therefore the tribes as well, are matriarchal; led by the wisest, the strongest, and the most cunning of the female kiom. According to Yki laws, there must always be at least one male on the council in the name of fairness. Tribes claim territories and hunting grounds, and to be caught hunting on another tribes lands incurs the harshest penalties. Most tribes accept, and even encourage, their young adults to seek mates from other tribes. It is customary for the male to join the female’s tribe, becoming a permanent member of his mate’s tribe.

Expulsion from the tribe is the most severe form of punishment, the offending individual forever forbidden from entering the tribe’s lands. To reinforce the punishment, a third of the Yki's tail is removed, along with a large portion of the ears.

Tribes identify each other by facial tattoos, and various styles of body ornamentation. Jewellery and ornamentation of the fur on the head and nape varies from tribe to tribe, and is also used for recognition.

## Social Roles

- **Nioti(e):** The young of the tribe are in charge of a few small chores, such as cleaning out the den and disposing of leftovers. Older Nioti/e help look after kits in the crèche, and assisting the tribe’s kiom.
- **Thill:** Thill usually fill the ranks of the tribe’s warriors, usually being larger and stronger than their male counterparts. The females usually occupy the occupations that require strength, such as smithing, where their size is put to good use. They are usually the more passionate of the Yki, more inclined to follow their heart instead of their head.
- **Arden:** Scout, mages, weavers; males take up the trades that require dexterity, agility, and swiftness. Males tend to be the calmer gender, more logical and levelheaded. Arden also occupy most of the religious fields, and it is often a male kiom that is the tribe's high seer.
- **Kiom-Nushib:** Females who are too old to hunt: the Kiom-Nushib not on the tribe council act as mentors to the younger generation. Adept telepaths, it is rare for them to speak aloud, preferring telepathy instead.
- **Kiom-Weshib:** Males too old to hunt, the Kiom-Weshib are mentors, much like the Kiom-Nushib. Strong mages and shape shifters, they are the spies of a tribe, and the Kiom-Weshib on the tribe council act as the voice of the male half of the tribe. 

## Religion

The Yki are spiritual and superstitious people, each tribe worshipping a patron deity. It is not unusual for a tribe shaman or seer to select a kit, and name it the tribe Dyp'khelp, or god child. This child is raised by the tribe priest or priestess, and is the centre of many religious ceremonies within the tribe. The chosen Yki is said to bring good luck, but if killed the tribe will be cursed. It is not uncommon for warring tribes to attempt to kidnap their enemies' Dyp'khelp, for a tribe without their godchild cannot hope to win against those with their deity’s support, and will immediately surrender.
