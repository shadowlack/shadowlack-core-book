**Djuberull** ("Graviball" in Ramathian) is a team sport played with two teams in an area with antigravity technology, hence the name. Each player aims to score points by shooting the ball into the opposing team's set scoring area, with the goal of getting a higher score than the other team before time runs out.

Due to the lack of gravity in the arena, tactics are more complex than they would be in a ground-based sport.

Unsurprisingly, many djuberull matches are played on space stations and the like.

It is speculated that this sport developed from a similar sport played underwater.
