==Field Regulations==

The playing field must be marked by lines of two colours (one for each team's side) on a flat surface; with dimensions being a large rectangle, with equilateral triangles at the opposite longest ends. The two scoring rings are at the farthest peaks of the triangles, on opposite sides of the field.

Every 5 feet, starting from the base of the triangle & start of the rectangle, is marked in a line. The centre line is marked with a thicker line, half being one team's colour, and the other half being the opposing team's colour.

The length of the rectangular section of the field is 60ft (18m), or 30ft (9m) per team, with a total of 13 5-foot lines. The width of the field is 40ft (12m). The triangles are 40ft (12m) on each side. The triangles are marked by lines radiating like an arrow from the scoring ring.

Rules
-----

-   Five players on the field, total of eight players per team. (Plus any second strand players a Coach may hold in reserve)
-   Two balls on the field during game play; one large 1ft (0.3m) diameter ball, bright white in colour, and one small 6in (.15m) neon blue ball.
-   Referees cannot be from either team, nor have allegiance to anyone on either team. Referees must be unbiased parties, so as to judge the game fairly.
-   Game play is in three segments of 15 minutes each, with five minutes rest between the thirds, and a five minute award ceremony afterwards.
-   Each segment is started with two referees, each with one ball, throwing the balls straight up into the air. A whistle is blown once the balls are in the air, and the clock and game play starts.
-   Scoring is accomplished by getting the ball in a single ring at the far end of the opposite team's field. The ring is circular, 3ft (1m) in diameter, on a pole, 5ft (1.6m) off the ground. The net is attached to the ring to catch the ball as it goes through the ring.
-   Getting the large white ball through the ring is 4 points. Getting the neon ball through the ring is 2.
-   If the score is tied at the end of the final third, there is a five minute rest period, and then the game is prolonged until someone scores, either ball, just once. At that time, the winner is announced, and the award ceremony begins.
-   Foul play is severely punished. Using magic on yourself, the ball, coach, referee, or on a player, by either spectator, coach, player, or other, is irredeemable. The most lenient punishment is banishment from the game, and all future games.
-   Fighting is prohibited. Arguing is not. But lashing out at anyone will render you stricken from that game. (One may resume either coaching or playing, the next scheduled game.)

Players
-------

-   The five Players hold the following ranks; 2 Chargers, 2 Blockers, 1 Wild. Each member wears a short coloured scarf tied securely just above the left elbow denoting their placement on the team.
    -   Charger: saddled with getting the balls to the other side of the field and scoring, must always be on opposing team's half of the field. Wears a red scarf.
    -   Blocker: must block balls from entering their side of the field, and may not cross centre line. Wears a blue scarf.
    -   Wild: May either charge or block, and go anywhere on the field. Wears a green scarf.
-   Each team has it's own colour, which is worn as a securely tied scarf on the right arm, just above the elbow. Team colours are decided by the team, and cannot be the same pattern and/or colour as another currently existing team.
-   Chargers and Blockers may touch only the small ball, in an attempt to score, or keep the opposing team from scoring. Wilds can touch either, but focus on the large ball. Penalty is awarded to purposeful hitting of the wrong ball.
-   All players can hit the balls however they please, so long as the balls are not damaged or punctured (by nails/teeth, etc). Penalty is awarded for damaging the ball.
-   Flying is allowed by both wings or magical means. Common sense will tell you to not go too high, however, because the scoring rings won't be leaving the ground.
-   Using one's wings to block or hit the ball to score is allowed, but one cannot keep their wings unfurled for more than a second to block or hit the ball. Penalty is awarded to the player who leaves their wings unfurled for longer than allowed.
-   Carrying of either ball is prohibited by anyone but the Wilds. And even then, Wilds must let go of either ball they hold after three steps, three seconds, or passing 10ft (two marked lines); whichever comes first. Carrying the ball may be continued in the air, but the time limit will then be held, and the ball must be dropped or thrown at the end of three seconds. Penalty is awarded should the ball be carried past what is allowed.
-   Should a player be hurt during game play, the clock is paused and the player is either healed, or replaced. Penalty is awarded for the player that hurt the injured one.
-   Once a player amasses 3 penalties against themselves, they must be sat down, and replaced for that entire game.
