**Stentrau** (*stone's throw* in [Khellakh](/languages/khellakh "wikilink")) is a traditional [Khell](/species/khell "wikilink") sport. Exactly when it began is unknown, but there are documents dated back to the 52nd millennium that give in-depth explanations of the rules. By the time the [Great Lockist War](/history/great_lockist_war "wikilink") occurred, there were continent-wide *stentrau* tournaments; it nearly died out during the war, but has since recovered. To this day, there are several national tournaments held annually.

On the surface, the sport itself appears simple: particularly strong Khellin lift large boulders and throw them as far as they can.
