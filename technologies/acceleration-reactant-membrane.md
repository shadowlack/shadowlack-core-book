This new, light weight form of armour has been developed by the USR and private contractors to deliver reliable protection to the front-line soldier in Extreme Velocity Combat.

While inert, A.R.M. is a flexible, translucent (often orange or steel blue) gel. Its outer film is non-adhesive and impervious to puncture. It can be folded and stored for easy transport, and because of its light weight properties, it is possible to stock most USR barracks in one transport.

Each A.R.M. is manufactured to the soldier's precise cranial dimensions, further adding to the promise of protection. When worn for the first time, the gel feels icily cold; at the point of contact, the membrane begins a method of adapting to the soldier's face and skull.

> Commonly, soldiers new to A.R.M. find it funny to have a gel-like film cover their face with eye holes "cut out".

However, when put under stress, A.R.M. tightens around the face and becomes perhaps the toughest material to ever protect this vulnerable region on any soldier. Stress comes in the form of extreme speeds, and relies on the wearer maintaining his or her speed while in combat.

Importantly, the Acceleration Reactant Membrane can be fitted to a standard visor set up. Additionally, the second highest ranking Senior Officer may request the full Exo-A.R.M. but understands this protection is experimental.

The Exo-A.R.M. comes in 4 crucial parts and weighs 10.5kg/23.14lbs:

- Hi A.R.M. (as described above);
- Low A.R.M. \[OPTIONAL\] (the same product, manufactured to fit below and around the jaw for more complete protection if necessary);
- A custom pivot fitted behind the ears of the soldier which acts as the mount for A.R.M and the Exo-plates.
- Exo-plates (which slide in tandem with one another when A.R.M. is either lifted or lowered around the face)

Exo-A.R.M. can impair a soldier's movement, and should only be used when the risk of mortality is virtually guaranteed and when little vehicular armour surrounds him or her.

It does, at this point in time, offer the soldier the choice to relentlessly engage a target of opportunity with exemplary protection to the face, head, shoulders, neck and jaw areas; the Exo-plates may also double as a backup if speeds drop too far to cause the A.R.M. itself to dilate again.

It should be noted: after prolonged usage (many years), the A.R.M. will eventually lose some of its dilatant properties and remain in the adopted shape of the wearer. It still provides protection, but needs to be allowed to relax first. There is the risk of fracture upon impact if it is used and not given time to relax.

ARF (Acceleration Reactant Film) is the humorous alternative acronym commonly chosen over ARM.

## Health warning

If A.R.M. fluid - the membrane - makes contact with any part of the anatomy, it will severely burn. If untreated, necrosis will set in. The membrane is highly volatile in its gelatinous state. If cracked in combat, it can still be worn but as soon as speeds drop below public speeds, the membrane will relax and MUST be removed instantly to avoid medical damage.

## Treatment upon contact

Specialist field medics will always accompany an "A.R.M.er" and may use their gloves to clean off small amounts of the membrane. Panels on the fingers and palms react to the membrane to freeze it and may be brushed off - like ice to gum stuck in hair.

## Disposal

Incineration. Toxic fumes may be recycled to begin manufacture of the protective film. Inhalation of the fumes affects rational processes, skin conditions and the heart.

## Public Variant

While still in development, there are plans to release a safe variant to replace helmets. Experimental versions may already be purchased as one off orders, but all liability is waived and sole responsibility remains with the buyer for his or her own safety. No claims may be brought against the USR.
