With Augmented Reality (AR) the internet is not a place you go so much as a parallel digital world. Which you experience as an overlay onto your normal range of senses. A Multi Processing Device (MPD) accesses the internet data from wireless connections around the person, feeding them the results via simulated senses or any other interface systems. AR sense inputs are specific to each user, varying on minor details.

In its most basic form AR is experienced as visual sight cues, usually seen as arrows. One can see these arrows by linking their smart goggles or display capable contact lenses, even display glasses to an MPD. The data appears as ghostly text and images in ones field of vision. This can be customized easily to filter out spam and non-necessary data. If a call happens a ringtone is sounded and an icon appears in the center of the vision, though transparent enough for the real world to be seen. The call can be moved to peripheral vision to not interfere with real life activities.

The other use for AR is to enjoy a sim or simulated reality, while being also in the real world. The sim uses any part of technology to play. Vision glasses, goggles, contacts. Headphones, earbud speakers, subdermal bone vibrating speakers. The latest in AR clothing can also be used for more reality, feedback clothing that allows the wearer to feel and touch with resistance, feel warmth and cold. Some of the more advanced AR sims can even relay emotions. This emotive sim system is still in trials and very rare to find.
