These specially designed contact lenses come in many different colours and designs. Made for use in conjunction with any PDA or laptop but mostly linked to an Multi Processing Device (MPD). With these lenses one can superimpose their digital display from their device over the sight of the real world. This can be incredibly useful for people such as special forces and the general population.

When used with voice recognition, motion sensors and other telepathic communication one can truly control their digital world while on the move. Access and play simulations. View maps live from GPS or even lock on automatically with smart-linked weapons.
