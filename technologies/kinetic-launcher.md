The **kinetic** launcher is a type of weapon which spins kinetic energy in ammunition commonly referred to as a *disk* which then releases the energy in a blast. The handgun models require licensing, as do the ship cannons. It is easily rechargeable as it merely requires motion to sap kinetic energy from.
