The first head set model made when Menlo was first invented and still being experimented with. This model is generally white, very bulky and does not adjust for head size. It is not recommended for game play for studies have shown that to much exposure to the game with this head set can cause eye problems. This model is no longer being produced and is considered a collectors item. (Dorky aint it?)
