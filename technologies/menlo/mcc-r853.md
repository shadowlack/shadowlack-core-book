This is a development of a headset after the R112, designed to be less idiotic and bulky. It was slightly more compact, adjustable, and sported a different type of eye piece.

It did not sell very well among beginners because it was difficult for them to get into (and stay in) the virtual world with only one eye piece. It is still manufactured though, and used by a few older players.
