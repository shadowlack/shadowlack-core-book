Multi Processing Devices (MPD) are the ultimate personal networking tool, used by almost everyone. They are a combination wireless router, cellphone, vidcam, PDA, GPS unit, chip reader, wallet/Khorta, and mobile gaming device all in one easy-to carry package that fits inside a pocket, belt-clip, or wrist-clip. MPD’s come in a dizzying array of shapes, sizes, and colors, from stylized head-sets or faux jewelry to cranial implants and MPD’s woven into the fabric of your jacket.

MPD’s are usually used to carry personal data and can replace the need to carry a Khorta. One’s personal ID, passport, medical history, education, bank balance, security clearances and more can all be uploaded and stored securely on the MPD. Many people freely broadcast certain chosen portions of their personal data for store wishlists, chatrooms and social networking, gaming services and the like. Of course most keep a close eye on how much they let the public see of their information.
