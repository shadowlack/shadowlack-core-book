## History

### Origin and current status

Originally Muses were designed to combat depression and other more destructive emotions but as its effectiveness and uses grew, shadier corporations bought out the research. Soon more emotions could be created for the users such as: bliss, happiness, sorrow, curiosity, anguish, fear, and even at high price, courage. Eventually the military was interested in this new ultimately useful product, in battlefields everywhere the soldiers of Ramath-lehi were courageous to their deaths creating victory even in the worst of situations.

Sadly the corporations never supplied the government the full evaluation of the product including its side effects. After many years of use soldiers where coming home disturbed not from the terrors of war but boredom. Some went out of their way to save people while other killed them due to nothing to do. The military investigated the product and eventually refused to use it and got the government to make it illegal. With no one else to sell to the corporations went to the black market on [Bhim](/countries/bhim) where sales have flourished.
