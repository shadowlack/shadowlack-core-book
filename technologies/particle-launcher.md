The particle launcher is a short-range projectile launcher. It is roughly shaped like a one meter long black tube that opens on one end. This open end flares out and has a diameter of about six inches. The other end is covered in a soft rubber-like material which can be pressed against the shoulder for support while the weapon is being fired. The portion of the weapon that is not flared out has a diameter of about four inches.

The gun has two handles and a clip. The first handle, held with the dominate hand, has a trigger on it. Pulling the trigger will result in discharging the weapon’s ammunition. The trigger can be held down to create a steady flow of projectiles from the muzzle of the gun. The second handle forms a ninety degree angle with the first handle. This handle, which is held with the secondary hand for support, may appear on either side of the gun depending on what the user’s secondary hand is. Lastly, the gun has a clip which hangs in front of the trigger handle. Each clip contains about 100,000 pieces of ammunition.

The Sandstorm, as some call it, has an effective range of about twenty-five feet. After traveling twenty-five feet, the weapon’s ammunition loses much of its velocity and spreads out too much to be seriously dangerous.

The small dust-sized objects projected by the particle launcher are actually manufactured steel cubes. The edges of the cubes will rip through soft-objects, especially flesh, but will always imbue into hard objects like wood. When the trigger of the particle launcher is pressed down, a Fronima powered fan in the back of the gun will active causing about a one second firing delay to give the fan time to begin running at full speed. The weapon will then begin to emit its ammunition at a rate of about 1,000 cubes per second. Each of these cubes will initially fly at high velocities. Any soft objects in the path of these tiny bullets will be shredded to pieces and carried away with the cubes in a very short amount of time. Victims of the particle launcher can be seen with exposed bone, most of the flesh and muscles ripped away at where they were shot.

The particle launcher is especially dangerous when aimed at the face. The eyes as well as important mucous membranes can be torn away in a matter of seconds when the gun is discharged. This weapon is primarily used for close-quarter combat, especially indoors. However, it has also been used by terrorists to massacre large groups of pendragons in city streets and other locations where pendragons may gather in large numbers.
