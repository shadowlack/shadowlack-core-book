A legendary powder that causes the drinker to sink when they hit water. It is highly illegal as it can slow the body down so much that it can cause the heart to stop. One of its many long-term side-affects is multiple organ failure.

Paupfaedhs is only manufactured on the continent of Bhim, where it created using the bodies of crushed Whis, several strains of deadly vegetation, and a special fermentation process. It is easily detectable in drinks and food, as it causes whatever it is added to to glow a soft blue. When Paupfaedhs comes in contact with magic of any kind, the soft blue glow increases in intensity and becomes hot pink. This makes it a very unlikely choice of weapon by industry professionals. 

- Plot:Fallen_Graders was linked to the death of a [Janardan](/schools/janardan-academy) student.
