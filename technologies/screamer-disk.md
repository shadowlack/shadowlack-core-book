The Screamer Disk is standard issue to most soldiers, it is completely flat and has a variety of useful features. Blades extend out of the sides when thrown, or alternatively energy blades extend out. It also functions as a boomerang, returning to the user after being thrown. It is also used as a melee weapon, as it can be used much like a knuckle duster. This weapon originated in ancient Takula society, where it was called the Kretar, and used mainly as a throwing disk.
