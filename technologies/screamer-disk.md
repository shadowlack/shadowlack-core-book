The **screamer disk** is standard issue to most soldiers, it is completely flat and has a variety of useful features. Blades extend out of the sides when thrown, or alternatively energy blades extend out. It also functions as a boomerang, returning to the user after being thrown. It is also used as a melee weapon, as it can be used much like a knuckle duster. It gains its name due to the high-pitched noise it makes while being thrown.

## History

This weapon originated in ancient [Takula](/species/takula) society, where it was called the *Kretar*, and used mainly as a throwing disk.
