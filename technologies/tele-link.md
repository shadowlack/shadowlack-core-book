Long range telepathic communications device.

Mass-produced by the Adamaint Empire, the Tele-link is a minuscule communications device that is widely popular with the general public. It is generally placed in or next to the ear. It is then able to pick up upon the user’s thought-speech, and project it to other pre-defined users.

Adding a user to your Tele-link contact list is relatively easy, although there is much criticism around the process. You must physically touch the two devices. The contact information will then automatically be shared. It is not possibly to “load” someone’s contact data onto your device without that person also having their Tele-link right there with you.

To make a call, the user need only to think about the individual that they wish to contact. The device then looks up their entry in the local database, and then sends the call out. The individual receiving the call is then presented with the name of the caller via thought-speech, and is given the option to either accept or ignore the call. Users also have the ability to set their tele-link to only accept calls from specific individuals, or even put their tele-link into Silent Mode, which will automatically reject and ignore any incoming calls.

Due to the nature of the technology, it is not considered a very secure means of communication. It can be tapped and monitored. As such, the Tele-link device is not used in times when the information being shared is considered sensitive.

One often overlooked feature of the Tele-link is its ability to store notes about things that you want to remember in its local storage. Do you keep forgetting what a horrible person your ex was? Well, you can store you thoughts and feelings on them and replay the stored set whenever you need to remind yourself.

Using a Tele-link device has proven to have no short or long term side-effects.
