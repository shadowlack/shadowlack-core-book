**Thasilm** is the brand name for a drug used on Ramath-lehi to treat patients who are suffering from seizures due to epilepsy. It is useful in treating the following seizure types: atonic (drop), tonic (stiffening), tonic-clonic (stiffening and jerking), and absence (staring). It has also been known to temporarily resolve cognitive impairment or intellectual delays that sometimes accompany patients who have a form of epilepsy.

Thasilm does not actually fix the problems that cause seizures. Instead, it works by preventing the seizures from occurring.

Many doctors do not recommend Thasilm because it must be injected directly into the blood stream. Instead they recommend more advanced medications which are available in both pill and liquid forms and may be taken orally. Unfortunately not everyone responds encouragingly to these medications, so Thasilm has remained in production.

Taking the right amount of seizure medicine on time every single day is the most important step in preventing seizures.

## Appearance
