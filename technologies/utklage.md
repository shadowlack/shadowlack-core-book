Utklage is, to put it simply, a capsule with healing magic inside of it.

More specifically, utklage is made from artifically synthesised chemicals designed to have positively-charged magic in them. The process of doing this is a lengthy and difficult one, and as such utklage is one of the most expensive medicinal drugs on the market. However, there are those who would argue that it is easily worth the price; while it works on numerous illnesses and injuries, perhaps the greatest argument in its favour is that it's one of the most effective "weapons" against magia morbii out there.

However, critics would point out that because of the laws of magic, there is no guarantee that it would be as effective as needed - and indeed, how well it works can vary. The drug is designed so that it carries a fairly strong charge (with differing amounts if need be), but even a failsafe can fail - and it is entirely possible to accidentally overdose.

Utklage came very close to being outlawed during The Flux, but was saved when the USR bought the company that manufactured it.
