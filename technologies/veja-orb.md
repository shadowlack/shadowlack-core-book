A primitive Ramathian explosive. As the name suggests, a **veja orb** is an orb containing highly concentrated fire magic - so concentrated, in fact, that when the orb is sufficiently damaged it explodes. While straightforward, these weapons are risky to use, and were eventually displaced by more advanced explosives with better failsafes.
