The **Vutmuca XR** is a smaller ship designed for both cargo transport and smaller scale battles. It comes equipped with a Fromina drive and two kinetic burst weapons, primed for fire functioning like machine guns. It is used for stellar travel and is favored by more experienced pilots. It is quite difficult to learn how to fly a Vutmuca XR though once a pilot does learn how to properly fly one, it becomes one of the smoothest flying ships you can find. It can also be used as cross-continental travel.
