Citizens of Ramath-lehi are generally schooled between the ages seven and twenty-two. During the years that they spend in various institutions they may specialize in a variety of subjects. However, most characters tend to only major in two trades. Trades should reflect what your character does, or wishes to do for a living.

## Trade ranks

A trade rank indicates how much knowledge and ability your character has concerning their chosen trade.

| Rank | Character Age | About |
| :----| :----         | :---- |
| Basic | 1 to 15 | Your character knows the fundamentals of the trade and have started to show promise in their trade area. Should time be allowed they could advance to the next level with their knowledge. |
| Apprentice | 16 to 23| Your character has considerable knowledge concerning their trade. A lot of the learning is done by the character him/her/itself with usually a supervisor or teacher monitoring/challenging their progress and aiding when needs be. |
| Journeyman | 24 to 30 and older| Your character knows really all there is to know about their trade. They have fully graduated from their teaching institution and may be under the guidance of a Master in their specific subject area. Most characters do not bother to pursue someone to act as their Master and are content with simply their graduated status. Journeyman status allows a character to teach the younger generation of characters. Those who have acquired Journeyman status or higher are allowed to teach younger generations of characters. So if you wish to roleplay a teacher, please make sure that they are 24 or older. |
| Master | 31 and older |  	Your character knows everything there is to know in their specified trade area. Some Master's reach out to the youth and teach them what they know while others are content to keep their vast knowledge to themselves. They are considered the "know-it-alls" on their subjects and should be respected. If a character is a Master on a specific subject they are, more often than not, recognized by the Graders (which in itself can be both a good and bad thing). |

> On character profiles, trades are ordered first by trade rank (Journeyman rank will show up before Basic), and then are ordered alphabetically. What order your character's trades are displayed in do not necessarily reflect what your character chooses to major in.
