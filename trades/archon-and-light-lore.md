Opposite of [Daemon and Darkness Lore](/trades/daemon-and-darkness-lore). A ancient and powerful form of magic that involves light, healing, and using more defensive magic (shields; protecting). Most with skill in this trade have had it handed down to them verbally, through books, or through self exploration and experience.
