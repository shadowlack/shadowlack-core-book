A magical art which can be more sinisterly orientated and often involves using magic in a negative and offensive (often very destructive) way. It has strong ties with darkness and the *Nothing* and can be more powerful then conventional magic, yet highly erratic. May also overlap [Daemon and Darkness Lore](/trades/daemon-and-darkness-lore) teachings.
