This Swarajian wedding tradition involves several separate celebrations over the course of a few weeks. It is an ancient and spiritual practise, often used by upper class Ramathians.

It all starts with the engaged couple’s consummation of their bond – and their conception of an egg. The couple usually spends the day together, oftentimes with other family members present, and basically celebrates their romance. When night falls, they meet up with a seer at a private location of their choice, usually their home. The seer, along with two female helpers, draws a ceremonial bath, adding oils and scents that are said to aid in conceiving. The two lovers spend roughly one or two hours in the bath and this is where they are expected to sexually consummate their relationship with the expectation of conceiving. During this time, a seer will stand outside but nearby, praying (to Dymikca and Ciba, and maybe even Hysgan Tdutl) and meditating on the conception of the Nioti. Other family members may be present in the general area, but most often it’s a private night between the lovers and the seer.

The main idea of this practice is for the egg to be present for the main ceremony, so the nuptials are timed roughly twenty days after the ceremonial bath and conception so that the Thill lays it on or before the day of the celebration. During and after the laying of the egg, the same seer returns to oversee and bless the unborn Nioti and also to pray (to Mytlad, Oyut, and Gniorun). As for the ceremony, which is referred to as "fastening," it takes place in two parts. In the first part, the couple, along with their parents, their egg, a witness or two, and an overseer, exchanges vows and rings in a private chamber. The second part comes afterwards, when the rest of the family and friends celebrate with the couple.

Oftentimes, the seer will visit the couple several times while their egg is incubating, to bless it, pray (to Oyutl and Gniorun) and meditate upon it, and also to discuss predictions, especially concerning tattoos. He or she is, of course, called when the actual hatching occurs.
