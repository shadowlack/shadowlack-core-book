The Omesea is a relatively modern ritual taking place over the course of a week, formulated for homosexual couples. In the first three days of the ritual is partying with the couple’s family and friends.

Beginning on Fespui, the couple invites their family, on Laipui, their most intimate friends, and on Jaspui the rest they wish to invite to their wedding. The fourth day is ended with celebrating and a wedding party, at which the couple give each other gifts, but do not exchange vows.

On the fifth day, the couple venture to a secret location of their choosing where they consummate their relationship. The three days following are spent with the couple being alone together, where they prove, in their own way, that each is the other’s world entire.

On Nerpui, with only the company of a government or religious official, the couple exchanges vows.
