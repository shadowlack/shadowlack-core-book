After a mate has been picked out by a male and they are both well on the way with their relationship, for marriage the male is expected to present the female with a gift as proof of his intentions. The gift is also a measure of wealth and can be used to determine who could better care for a female. If the gift is accepted then after a fairly short period of time later the couple will be expected to have a ceremony.

At the ceremony the male and female walk together with their tails entwined at the front of a parade containing all their invited guests and families. They usually have to make their own vows of some kind, and after that they use the male's tail flame to melt a metal such as gold. This is then poured into to moulds on the spot and used to make two matching rings or bracelets which are a symbol of their unity.
