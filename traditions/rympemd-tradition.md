A fairly modern tradition that ties into old customs from the Sudesha region is the Rympemd ceremony. 10 days after the male purposes to his mate a large party is held at either of the parents of the engaged house. (Who ever is willing to hold the party) Everyone is invited to this celebration and the parties are known to last long into the night. It’s during this party that everyone is celebrating the new life that the couple is about to being as they work their way toward their marriage. Within the next few days, plans are made for the saying of the vows and exchange of gifts between the couple. Lots of thought is put into the gifts and neither of the pair is able to ask for help in what they give each other.

Most of the family stays around during this time between the party and the binding ceremony, comforting the couple and showing their support for the marriage.

When the couple are finally ready for the saying of vows and exchange of gifts, they gather alone with a seer or religious master at dawn to perform a small ceremony where the two will express their love in words and gifts that best represent their other half (often the gifts are similar by chance because of the connection there’s said to be between a couple that’s truly in love.)

For the rest of the day, they spend it completely alone with each other. It is often during this time when they consummate their marriage and promise each other that they will be together forever. Some times, a small gathering is held the next day with the immediate family where the parents will give there finale blessing on their children.

After that, every five years and one day a large party is often held at the opposite families home, (opposite from the first party) where the couple will once again exchange new vows, promising each other to one another. From then on the party moves back and forth between each household.
