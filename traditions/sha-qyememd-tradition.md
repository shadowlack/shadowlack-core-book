Marriage among the [Yki](/species/yki) is both a serious, and highly jovial occasion for all those involved. Once a male and female have made the decision to become lifelong partners, the male (or on rare occasion the female) leaves their home tribe to join their future mate in their tribe. The newcomer is treated as an outsider, set up in a temporary shelter on the outskirts of the settlement, where over the course of a week they are visited by the adults of the tribe who will inspect the male/female. At this time, if any problem arises regarding the ‘dragons suitability/compatibility, this is the point where any who wish to do so will approach the medicine dragon and voice any concerns. If any serious issue arises, the ceremonies will be postponed indefinitely until things are either solved or dismissed.

The Yki mate for love only, and there is no unspoken obligation for an unwed pregnant female to mate at any point to the father of her offspring. In many cases couples never produce children, either due to environmental or political conditions –such as famine or war- or they’ve discussed the idea and decided against having kits. Their beliefs incorporate the fact that a pairs bond extends into Fronima, and that their spirits will once again be together in death. Re-marriage is a highly frowned upon taboo, almost viewed with the same distaste as prostitution in other parts of the world.

The ceremony is accompanied by a day of feasting, drinking, storytelling and general good spirits. The act of the medicine ‘dragon ‘bonding’ the pairs spirits together is a public event, will all who are able enough attending. A small amount of blood drawn from the tribes dyp'khelp is used by the medicine ‘dragon to draw small markings on the face, nape, and the pads of the forepaws of both partners, small glyphs meant to bless and protect the new couple. Small tokens are exchanged between the male and female, usually ornaments of precious and semi-precious stones as well as coloured glass and wooden beads. The gifts are most often worn by both for the rest of their lives; perhaps an anklet of carved ivory, or colourful beads woven into the mane or hair, but they are symbolic things left over from a time when the Yki had to prove to a potential mate that they were capable of providing. It is often regarded that the better the craftsmanship and the rarer the parts of the gift, the stronger the bond will be.

Whichever party, male or female, is joining the tribe is greeting warmly by all members of their new home, and is showered with gifts in an act similar to the way a youth is accepted into adulthood. The tribe as a whole helps to construct the home for the pair, as well as to help move into it. Gifts given are most often things useful for establishing a new home, such as bedding, cookware, and clothing. Beaded arm guards and cloaks are particularly popular in most of the larger tribes.
